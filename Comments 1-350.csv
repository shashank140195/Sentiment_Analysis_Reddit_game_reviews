"**Battlefield 4**
    
Not interested in Battlefield at all, as im no multiplayer kinda guy (I suck at competitive gaming), but seeing it discounted with 4,5, and 1 as one package is pretty good deal. They all have campaign if im not mistaken, unlike the new 2042, so im in, maybe check multiplayer for a while, but its dead in my region, can't find any match at all, though not a big deal as im just in mainly for the campaign.
  

  
Looks pretty damn good for 8 year old game, though god damn these excessive lens flare and bloom are killing me. FOV not working on SP somehow? whats up with that, the default FOV makes me dizzy. So i used Flawless Widescreen, it does works, but it really showed that they didn't plan this game to be played on anything other than default. Animation become all fucked up, especially during cutscene, at one chapter on a boat where we rescue civilians, i phased from the boat then fall into the sea at the end of the cutscene. Then when were on an airfield getting blasted by missiles airstrike, the camera gets wildly out of control. It happened again when next chapter at the tram, the screens sits stationary but the sounds indicated that the tram is rolling downhill. Its pretty funny. Somehow affect other character as well, phasing through wall, not holding weapons rights, etc. I dont know if its the game itself, or the FW program, but the AI seems pretty dumb as well, teammate cant shoot straight, so are the enemies. It was buggy as fuck too, at one point enemies helicopter teleporting weirdly before going down, and somehow enemies inside it are still alive, but not before they're phasing deep into the ground. I didn't mind it all, find it amusing, though the biggest problem of them all is that it affect the targeting behind cover, even when i have a clear shot in my reticle, the bullet somehow shot the wall, pretty annoying
  

  
Story was meh, regular bombastic military schlock, nothing memorable, i enjoy it fine but i'd like my hours back lol. Even Michael K Williams cant saved it from mediocrity, bit of a waste of talent. Though, man, pretty sad we wont see him act ever again, he always stole a show whenever he showed up. I didn't know anything about Battlefield campaign, so i was pleasantly surprised to see him here, though quickly got sad when i remembered he was gone.",Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Negative,Negative,

**Psychonauts**
 
Finished it. Holy hell, this game is just filled to the brim with personality, truly shine at the level design of different NPCs mental minds and worlds. Super creative, i totally see why this became a cult classics, never seen anything like it in a platformer before. Each with distinct look, atmosphere, and even the way to beat each levels are pretty unique. I see people singled out Milkman Conspiracy as the best, but god damn, i loved every single level pass the tutorial (Oleander, Sasha, Milla level are kinda basic), which is a shame, since with my complaint before about scuffed platforming control, combined with those uninteresting first few levels, i could see why some people would quickly dropped this game.
  
Honestly, if it werent for the control, this game could easily earned its place at the top of my best platformer of all time list. No joke, it is that good for me, barring the control. Entertaining characters, intriguing story and lore, endearing jokes, im totally enjoying my time in Psychonauts. Im definitely in for Psychonauts 2 later, didnt realise that the first game ends up with a sequel bait. Now, i see why fans  dying to see a sequel to the game back in the day. Imagine being impressed with the game, hyped up for the sequel at the end, but then hearing news that it was considered a commercial failure. So fucking glad that the sequels actually happens now, better late than never. Can't wait to jump on the sequel, but i'm tempted to try another Double Fine game first already on my library, which is Brutal Legends.
  

  
Another thing i want to say, i was kinda expecting some kinda tragic mental worlds in one of the levels, as i remembered reading an article years ago about one of the character in Psychonauts hiding some dark and heartbreaking backstory, but im hazy on the details. I finished the game without finding anything of the sort ( there's definitely a lot of sad backstory in the game though, but not that dark as the way i remembered when i read said articles). So i wondered and search for that article again, and found that it was actually a >!hidden nightmare from Milla, which is why i missed it since i was too focused on doing the tutorial level.!< So i checked it and yeah, pretty dark and sad,>! just the way it shows that memory locked up deep in a room with no light, then the nightmare screaming those sentences. Maybe im coping a bit to make me feel better about what i've seen, but another way i'm looking at it, shows that Milla managed to control her nightmare, and moving on from her past, though not entirely forgotten about it nor let the trauma consume her. !<Anyway, great stuff.

I've been struggling to get invested in this. Arkane is my favorite dev, it's a good game and I like it but it still hasn't really hooked me. I've just been poking away at it.

It's L4d but modern with all the good and bad that entails. Some things are better, some are worse but so far I'm enjoying it.

"**Battlefield V** 

I was in the minority who really enjoyed the 2042 beta despite all its flaws but it just got me in a Conquest mood so I hopped back into this. I always enjoyed this game. DICE has a history of terrible launches but not once have I ended up disappointed by the state they get the game into eventually (okay Battlefront I so maybe once but even then it had its moments). The same is true of Battlefield V. I think itâ€™s been left in a wonderful state and itâ€™s incredibly fun to play with a huge variety of maps and environments and insane moments. Iâ€™m still not a fan of splitting Tactical & Strategic Conquest but since thatâ€™s my biggest complaint Iâ€™d consider it a fantastic experience. ",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,
"**Super Mario 64**

Started this after completing Echoes. About 2 hours in. I thought this was my first time playing but now that Iâ€™ve started something tells me Iâ€™ve played a little before when I was super young. Crazy how good the controls hold up & honestly crazy how good everything holds up. Iâ€™m playing the 3D All Stars version so i donâ€™t know if they updated the controls at all, but if they didnâ€™t wow. I canâ€™t imagine how transformative this mustâ€™ve been when it came out. Excited to keep going & now that the NBA starts back up on Tuesday it will be perfect to play during commercials and halftime. Only 3D Mario Iâ€™ve ever beat is Odyssey so, even though Iâ€™ll spread them out, this collection should be a wonderful history lesson for me. ",Positive,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,

"**Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye** 

Completed this on Thursday. Somehow theyâ€™ve created a new full sized masterpiece inside of a game that was already a masterpiece. In some ways exceeds the base game despite that actually being impossible. Has now cemented Outer Wilds as my favorite game of all time. Before it was my number 2 teetering on the edge of being my number 1 but this DLC blew that door open and now itâ€™s without a doubt my number 1. Just pure unfiltered genius around every corner & under every stone. Thank you Alex & Kelsey Beachum & Andrew Prahlow & everyone at Mobius. Youâ€™ve left me both speechless and unable to stop thinking about this experience. What fucking adventures youâ€™ve given me. ",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,
"**Splitgate**

Best game for a quick match or 2. Really still love it and canâ€™t wait till we get to see the fruits of some of that $100 million. Will surely hop back in pretty hard once there is a significant update but will probably continue to play intermittently til then.  ",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,
"I played roughly 7 hours of **Aragami 2**.

I really enjoyed Aragami 1 and beat it, but I felt no need to beat 2. The story is based around a series of missions from a hub world. The hub world is largely trivial with only two or three places worth frequenting. The missions (30ish in all) take place in a handful of locations, with different objectives and occasionally different parts of the level unlocked.

After 7 hours, I had seen all the game has to offer. 7 hours is generous, because I play slow and go for Silent Assassin rankings. In 7 hours I completed over a dozen missions, and in all of them there are only 4 enemy types, which I have read persists through the game: soldier on patrol, soldier unmoving, ranged archer on patrol, non combatant on patrol.

The majority of enemies are rendered vulnerable by the initial skill in the skill tree, Whisper, which allows Aragami to call the nearest enemy over to the shadows and murder them/hide their body. Rinse and repeat until your route is clear. The skill tree offers some unlockable assassination techniques but they are mostly body disposal and unnecessary stealth enhancement. The enemies are on fixed paths and will never notice a missing person.

The most frustrating thing about the game is objectives unlocked only after completing subsequent objectives, meaning the goal of the level is sometimes unclear. For example, *Objective 1: Reach the Place*. What place? I stealth all the way into the huge-and-obvious-looking castle, but later learn I was supposed to stealth to a barn to overhear a conversation about a secret passage into the castle... which I already found! Only then does *Objective 2: Locate the Secret Passage* unlock. Then I have to go all the way back to the castle! Better level design would have allowed me to skip the first objective after locating the passage on my own.

Although it sounds mostly negative, the game IS fun. Just not compelling to play. If they had put any work into the plot whatsoever, and dumped the hub world, added some more enemy types, maybe I would have bothered to finish it.

"**The Good Life**

If it wasn't for backing this, I would not be playing this but I have and while clunky, it's got a lot of charm to its design. Like the little city, the music is cool and the amount of fun some of the voice actors are having adds a decent amount of joy to this game. Yeah, the writing has a repeating problem (The happiest town in the world is said in the prologue part 1 5 times in 4 minutes and there's hellhole which is said a lot) and I find the way the clock works so annoying in how quick it is but it's cute. Don't know how long I'll play (does anyone know how long it is?) but we'll see. ",Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,Neutral,
"**Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order**

I really dig this. There's a nice flow to the whole combat system, I like the look and the movement is a little stagnant sometimes but once you get wall-running it feels so nice. While I haven't gotten more to the clone combat stuff (I'm onto the third planet), I like the combat and overall swing of the lightsaber. The customization is cool, the story starts off fun but the second planet has cool things to it but it does slow the story down to a point that felt too long. Still having fun and I hope to get through a lot this week,

"Replayed **Wasteland 3** and got expansion pack as game just released its final DLC. The core game is amazing, role played in completely different manner and game felt completely differently than on first playthrough. The options, choices and consequences are bloody fantastic. So in short - it just confirmed it's bloody fantastic and I can't recommend it enough. 

Now sadly **DLCs** are not as great as base game, especially the second one **Cult of the Holy Detonation** - it just felt so out of place lore wise and with new mechanics, that made gameplay just completely obnoxious and not fun at all. Also neither of character or story moments hooked me on it so gave up not even hour into it. The first DLC - **The Battle of Steeltown** was a lot better and its tied to base game a lot more lore wise, as it's Patriarch's factory and you go to deal with the situation - decent characters, decent lore, passable new game mechanics.

Oh also, they fixed long load times and performance - since launch. 

To sum up, if you haven't played it yet, go for base game and probably ignore DLCs, or at least the holy detonation (2nd) one. ",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,

I work a pretty high stress job, and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a game to help them wind down. It gives off Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing vibes.

I'm having a hard time enjoying Far Cry 6. I actually liked the 5 most of the series and it's interesting to see people liking 6 more than 5.

"**[puzzle agent:](https://www.gog.com/game/puzzle_agent)** tried it many years ago, didn't really grab me, but recently I thought I should give it another shot and picked it up on gog for cheap. pretty short, some puzzles can fuck off (logic-wise, would've never figured them out) and there are some annoyances (can't skip the results screen, etc.), but overall it's good stuff.",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,

"**[stranded sails (demo):](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1026100/)** tried this when it first came out 2 years ago, it was pretty bad, but they did a lot of improvements since then and updated the demo too, and it's not the beginning of the full game, so a bit of extra content. regular movement and rowing don't cost energy anymore, but sprinting and faster rowing still does, which is a bummer (base rowing speed is fine at least). and it still looks like the cheap mobile game it also is, with no grass or stone textures, it's ugly as fuck. I don't normally care about graphics and the rest looks fine, but this is just lazy and cheap, yet somehow 25 eur for the pc version seemed like a good idea to them. it's currently -60% but still not jumping on it, gonna have to go below 5 eur. the problem is, I'm in the mood for this sort of thing and last weekend's free trial of a similar game wasn't enough (and the 20 eur pricetag was too much), so it's a bit tempting. then again, they both only took a few hours combined, instead of 20 each, so I could play other stuff.

no manual saving, but it saves on exit and autosaves are continuous, not only after sleeping at the end of the day, which isn't mandatory, just keep eating and exploring at night. so much better than the way **stardew valley** wastes the player's time. fast travel got patched in, 'immersive' with a telescope, so a lot less useful than just selecting something on the map you already have, but it can only be used to teleport back to base. good amount of settings, including various text display speeds up to 'instant', but no separate slider for annoying ui sounds, they're grouped with sfx.

item tooltips cover half the screen, ruining crafting, but they can be toggled. the inventory is fucky too. should be tab to open it and 1 for shovel, 2 for bucket or whatever, but nope, numbers are for other stuff and tab and mousewheel fuckery is necessary to find and use the tools you need, simply clicking a tree with an axe symbol doesn't work. what the fuck else would I want to do with a tree? this makes farming annoying as fuck, as you gotta select seeds to plant first, then click on hole, then switch to bucket to get water and use it (putting it away removes water from the bucket), etc. it should be more streamlined, especially since bridges and stuff can be used by interacting, then the game asking if you wanna use the obvious item or not.

also, food items don't stack and combat is still shit. no dodging, no health bars on enemies, just run around and swing your sword. so yeah, 5 bucks tops, but 2 bucks from a bundle would be better, though this publisher doesn't do bundles. then again, they're into match-3 and solitaire otherwise, so this might be a humble monthly headliner soon, the way things are headed.",Positive,Negative,Negative,Neutral,Negative,

"**Assassins Creed 2**

I recently decided to play through the Ezio trilogy for the first time. I started with AC1 cause I wanted some background with the present day storyline. AC 2 was a vast improvement over the very repetitive first game. The parkour isn't perfect and certainly gave me my fair share of frustration, but it still serves its purpose and is fun. The combat isn't great, but I tried to play stealthy as much as I could anyway. I loved upgrading the Villa, the assassin tombs, and the mission with Leonardo's flying machine. The story was pretty interesting and I quite liked Ezio and especially seeing his growth, the shining moment being his speech in Sequence 13 (DLC) in which he tells the people to find their own truths and not to follow anyone including Ezio himself.

45 hours in and Iâ€™m wrapping things up soon. Iâ€™m on Case 10, so I have another case or 2 to go. Iâ€™m a bit at the point where Iâ€™ve gotten my fill from the puzzles. Theyâ€™re no longer as fun to go through. Puzzles have heightened a bit in difficulty, even though I still get a few her and there that are laughably easy and hardly qualify as a puzzle. 

The toothless tone of the game is really grinding my gears though. Initially, I liked the happy-go-lucky appeal to it all, but I do think this game can benefit from an antagonist. The best you get as far as a villain is Emiliana, who laughs at Katrielleâ€™s case-solving abilities, since  Emiliana is a trained professional, working for the Yard, but even then, sheâ€™s just a rival, with the same goals as Kat. Thereâ€™s only so many times you can pull off the endearing wrap up to a case that I can take.

I got back into Tetris Beat since they fixed the biggest issue with the game; that being the rhythm aspect not being accurate.

"**Picross S Genesis and Master System Edition**

I feel a bit guilty putting another Picross game in my backlog, since I recently abandoned the behemoth that is Pokemon Picross, but to be fair, this is the first Picross game Iâ€™ve purchased on Switch. Gameplay is as expected. Iâ€™m not much of a Genesis/Master System guy, I got the Genesis Mini and hardly touched it beyond Street Fighter and Tetris, but I still like educating myself with retro games of that era, so it does motivate me to play these games at some point.

Iâ€™ve got to try Color Picross for the first time, which is Picross, but now with different prompts for different colors. This is an aspect that is built naturally within Picross 3D, but Color Picross has a bit more variables to it.

"**Hitman**    

The only game in the series I had played before was Hitman Absolution, which I really enjoyed but I understood the criticism that it was too linear and didnâ€™t give players enough freedom. Hitman (2016) felt like a completely different game and much more focused on puzzle-solving compared to Hitman Absolution which was more of a stealth action game. I loved Hitmanâ€™s gameplay and the game kept finding new ways to impress me with the level design throughout. I can see that the game isnâ€™t for everyone since it requires a lot of patience (literally, since youâ€™ll be waiting around a lot). The maps are gorgeous and exploration was great as I constantly found new tools or tips for assassinations (with the exception of Bangkok, a lot of the rooms felt disappointingly empty). Exploring the maps and following the targets until I finally devised a plan to take them out was extremely rewarding. The assassinations are extremely creative and often have a black humor element to them which was enjoyable. The highlight of the game for me had to be all the hilarious ways to exploit Silvio Carusoâ€™s mental breakdown in Sapienza. Each mission has several opportunities to set up an assassination, but they did feel like they hold your hand a bit too much so I avoided them for at least my first playthrough of each map. The game is designed around replay ability of each map and it was pretty fun to go back and find out all the different ways you could kill a target. The AI is dumb, but not in a bothersome way. Itâ€™s mostly funny to see how dumb they are and the game would be too challenging if the AI was actually smart. My only real complaint is that the quality of the levels can really vary a lot. The first two levels, Paris and Sapienza, feel near perfect. They offer so much to discover and have fantastic assassination opportunities. Then, the next two levels are alright, Marakeshâ€™s central hub doesnâ€™t offer that much, and Bangkok is a little boring. Colorado kinda sucks since you have to take out four targets and nearly everyone is hostile. Hokkaido is good and really gorgeous, but a bit small and simple. My friend said this is less of an issue in the sequels, so Iâ€™m looking forward to playing them. ",Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,
"That brings me next to **Shadow Hearts 2** aka the unfortunately vaguely named **Covenant.** They probably avoided calling this game 2 because it's really more the >!Steins Gate 0 to its Steins Gate.!< I am obviously a bit spoiled on this game from reading up on it, but still excited to see how things play out. 

So far I have to say it's crazy that 1 and 2 are on the same system. 1 was like a glorified PS1 game with the prerendered backgrounds and low detail character models, while this feels genuinely next-gen (for the era). Still makes use of the fixed camera angles to an extent, but not nearly as static-feeling. 

Gameplay feels a lot snappier and so far I like what they're doing with the slottable magic and the way fusions work. I forgive them for deleting Yuri's seraphic radiance that I worked SO HARD to acquire. At least the mistletoe is a plot justification for it. 

The concept >!of Yuri living on for Alice and trying to protect the town where she was buried is pretty powerful. Especially since he said late in 1 that if she died he would too.!< He'd probably kick my ass but I wanna give him a hug. ",Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Neutral,
"I beat **Shadow Hearts**. Uh, don't play the undub copy floating around out there on the internet...the bad ending movie got flipped or overwritten over the good ending, which caused me quite a degree of annoyance troubleshooting. 

But yeah, I liked the game so much I paid thru the nose for a copy on ebay. This is the definition of a quirky niche JRPG that doesn't fit in quite any one mold. The weird mix of eastern and western mysticism culminating in eldritch outer gods stuff is just great. Starting off I wasn't sure what to make of Yuri, but by the end I really liked him a lot and was cheering for him through his internal struggles. ",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,
"Also fired up **Ender Lillies** which has been fun so far. It pretty much seems like it does everything Hollow Knight does but a little bit worse, which means it's still good. The artwork and atmosphere are beautiful, while the combat does feel a little stiff/weightless. For the two bosses I've fought - the intro one and then a Viking warrior - the first was insanely easy and the second was also easy but took forever.

"In anticipation of getting Dread, I played through **Metroid Fusion**, which is my third Metroid game after playing Super and the original. Super still holds the title as my favorite, but Fusion was fun and the controls were so much smoother. It was a nice Alien adventure.

"I also played **Symphony of the Night** which was my first Castlevania game. I absolutely adored it - the atmosphere of the castle with the soundtrack and beautiful sprite-work was great, as well as just some of the general goofiness of the game.

There are definitely flaws - incredibly easy, the map % thing is a bit weird in certain spots, etc. - but the whole thing is so charming that it just has a special quality to it that's hard to explain.",Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Negative,

Picked this back up, had it since launch. Want to beat it before D/P launch next month. I also have never completed a PokÃ©dex before so going to try and do that. Seems like the easiest game to do it in. 

Itâ€™s mind blowing to me though how much more polished this game is than Sword and Shield. The overworld graphics are significantly better, character models are sharper.

Absolutely loved it. The gameplay itself was quite fun. It was nice playing a Dishonored-esque game where you donâ€™t get penalized for using the tools at your disposal.

My only complaint was that there was a singular method to get to the end (which I get, having multiple would have been pretty difficult probably).

"**Dark Souls 3 (cont.)**

Didn't get as much time to play this week but I can tell you that >!Oceiros is a bastard!<.

After beating a bunch of bosses that were not too bad, >!Oceiros!< was a huge difficulty spike out of nowhere for my sorcery mage. I ended up skipping him and the optional areas til I get some crystal spells (and apparently an ice one from the DLC). There's a way to cheese him but I didn't want to resort to that too soon.

I also thought the >!Yhorm!< fight was not that great as it feels like you're forced into using the >!Storm Ruler!<. You either use it or spend an ungodly amount of time chipping away at this 30k HP with your regular attacks. I thought these >!Lord of Cinders!< guys would be a lot harder but I suppose I'm not finished yet.

I also accidentally >!killed Grierat!< by going to certain area's bonfire too early. Sorry, dude.

I'm up to the >!Grand Archives and my good buddy, Crystal Sage 2.0!<. It took me far too long to remember to take off my Crown of Dusk.

"**Assassin's Creed Origins** (PS4) - Still plugging away at this, grinding to be able to start the story mission in Krokodilopolis (so around two thirds of the way through) - my thoughts will cohere a bit better when I've finished the main story but I'm finding it a bit inconsistent. Although there are more multi-stage story (and sidequest) missions, I'm finding the actual story a bit undercooked. Instead of building up the targets through a few missions, in some cases you're given all the information about who you're going to kill in just one. Whilst the 'confession' scenes are a decent visual upgrade, they don't quite compensate for this shortcoming. Bayek is still the best thing about this - I like his asides on cities and bits of the missions. There have been some weird surprises such as the whole potion part, and I like subtle teases towards the foundation of the Assassin Order's ideology in some sidequests, but it does kill the flow a bit when you suddenly hit a wall and have to go back and do some sidequests because your level isn't high enough. The open world is still great to travel through, which helps with backtracking. I don't like the lack of a 'progress bar' - I'd like to know how many missions are going to show on the map without having to manually scroll through it. I'll aim to finish the main story this week.

"**Ys IV Memories of Celceta  - Part 2 (PC)**

I gotta say, after being lukewarm at first, certain elements grew on me. Mainly the gameflow and combat. The flow is very smooth, which is a standard for the franchise, but in Celceta it felt a bit extra smooth. The combat really grew on me and I think it'd actually be rewarding and fun to play on higher difficulties. My fault for starting on normal. The game's fault for not letting me switch mid-game. I blame achievements. 

What hasn't grown on me was the story and characters. I don't wanna say its ""weaker"" than Dawn's, because it definitely has more meat to it. But it was less interesting and on point for me. Dawn is like Indiana Jones: simple premise, great execution. I loved how Dawn tied into the first two games, bringing old locations back and how the mask of the moon was the mask of eyes from the first game. And Dogi being in the game instead of just being in a cutscene. Also Celceta didn't have that extra comfy post credit scene with Dogi and Adol on a ship, talking about reaching Felghana soon. In terms of characters, good cast but I'm over the arrogant little girl stereotype like Nina and Calilica. 

I found the ending anti-climatic, and the story about Eldeel steering the world's politics and humanity's advancement quite lacking. There's major implications when someone directly controls the outcome of wars, and how and when humanity reaches certain steps for the sake of balance. And a generic *""I guess humanity has to make its own fate now""*, when that rug is pulled is not a satisfying conclusion. 

I wanna talk about Eldeel's redesign. Four wings instead of two. I thought its to symbolize that he has two beings in one body. But he said that his other personality formed over time, and it wasn't there from the start. So I guess he didn't just grow an extra pair of wings then. Could it be that two wings would be too close to religious imagery and Falcom doesn't wanna touch that anymore? But the ingame statues still had two wings iirc. Maybe they just thought it looked cooler? 

Overall, its still the one I enjoyed the least. But its not a bad game at all. It didn't have any low lows. But it also didn't have those high highs that make the other games stand out. It was just ""there"" in the middle from start to finish. Maybe I'm more critical because I loved Dawn so much?

**Ys V Kefin the Lost City (SNES)**

The black sheep of the franchise, because it bombed heavily and put Ys on ice for almost a decade. Well... I loved it!

You know when you finish a game and it leaves you on some sort of high? That's me right now. Great game, with a great ending. The way the story unfolded, the cast of interesting characters taking an active role in the story, the pacing, etc. It really is a solid package.  It starts slow, but once it gets going, its as Ys as Ys can be. In fact, I think the overall pacing, story, and especially the bittersweet and adventurous ending, encapsulate the ""feeling"" of Ys better than any other Ys game I've played so far.

The set up might be my favourite of Ys. Kefin the ancient city of alchemy vanished 500 years ago, only leaving a desert behind. And Adol is being hired by a local big shot to help uncovering its secrets. Including a mysterious woman trapped in crystal. A sorcerer turned beast protecting her. A desert that keeps expanding and swallowing up the land. The story of Kefin had some unexpected twists, and the end for the bad gal's plans(and herself) was bittersweet. You actually come to understand her frustration at one point. 

Let's talk gameplay. Its easy. *Very easy.* You can literally facetank most bosses and will have finished them before needing to have a potion. It's magic system is completely useless. The magic animation is so long that you're not hitting anything because enemies have moved halfway across the screen by the time you actually use magic. The alchemy magic system means that 95% of chests in the game contain elemental stones, which makes exploration rather depressing. But the actual gameflow is great, and together with story, carries this game. Bump combat is gone, attack, block, and also jumping, are a thing now. The music is great, but held back by the SNES limitations. 

Dungeons are small. Really small. They're basically shrines with 3-5 rooms each. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. It helps with the pace. Also, the game has no filler dungeons or anything. Several scenes that any other game would've thrown a dungeon in, just to pad the game out, are kept as ""cinematics"". Like when the bridge collapses under Adol and Terra, throwing them into the underground, and being attacked by monsters before making their way out. Its a cinematic. Or the return to the desert in the second half, a cinematic skipping backtracking entirely. The game actually *wants* to move forward, which is a breath of fresh air in an industry that loves padding more than anything. 

Ultimately, a great game. Also a really good SNES game. I heard that some people don't like it because it tries to be a Square RPG, but it doesn't. Its much closer to Enix ARPGs, like Terranigma actually. Finished it in about 6-7hrs. I definitely recommend it not just to people wanting to play Ys, but to anyone loving SNES era games.

**Ys VI The Ark of Napishtim (PC)**

Loved it!

To get the bad, and the only bad thing right out of the way: grind is build into the game. Some enemies cannot even be hurt unless you, or rather your weapons, have the right lvl. And farming the necessary currency gets excessive. It's taking the ""level up actually means something in Ys"" principle and turns it up to ""is absolutely necessary to progress."" It's hurting the great flow all the other games had so far. And the Limestone cave was the most annoying dungeon I can remember playing in a long time.

What I loved though, is about everything else. What a hype CGI ending that was. Still love the Napishtim Engine(if you ask me they could be using it forever.) I love how the backstory is coming together as you finally learn about the ""grave sin"" the ancestors of the dark tribe commited. And Adol is starting to get famous. Mentioned in the beginning but also the end when Ernst is listing Adols past adventures. Loved the progression between the two villages, and how the stories of both moved forward throughout the game. The artwork is great, and Terra being part of the cast was great too. Where's Wally tho? Adol's sidekick from Ys V. I felt so bad for him getting left behind in the end... Also loved the optional bosses and secrets, as well as the three weapon system. 

Honestly there's not much to say. Loved it, and its starting to get difficult putting them in order. Which says a lot about the general quality of Ys games. I think I liked it a bit more than Felghana overall. 

**Ys Seven Part 1(PC)**

I think Seven's artwork might be my favourite so far. It's modern, but its not bland(which I felt a bit with Celceta and Chronicles's new artwork.) Still has the right detail and simply that certain something. Also not afraid to look rugged. The Engine on the other hand, is easily my least favourite. It has *not* aged well. After getting used to it, its ok and has a certain N64 charm to it. But overall its rather bleak. It also feels like the game is too small for the engine. Hard to explain what I feel here, but if it was in Napishtim's engine, the sizes of areas would be fine. It feels a bit like it doesn't match in this one.

This is the first game in that new style that Ys still uses from what I've seen. And it kinda shows. Things are a bit clunky at times, like ranged characters. General combat, much like Celceta, feels a bit weak. BUT: Bosses are *on point!* They all look like dog toys due to the engine, but by god, they require a lot of focus. The difficulty is perfect, and each one has been gripping so far. Its a perfect when you clench your butthole but still make it on the first try. 

Banging intro cinematic! I've just reached Ruin Island, so I'm not too far (I think?). Story is ok but so far its nothing major. The country is experiencing earthquakes and disease. Adol is visiting shrines and everyone is wondering why he's chosen to get the shrines' blessings that nobody else ever got. There's a connection between this, but it hasnt been uncovered yet. Geis is back! And he's become part of the group as well, which I love. Please don't die Geis.

Going good. I don't love it(yet?), but I like it.

---

As said its becoming difficult putting them in order. Chronicles still reigns supreme, but right behind comes this gooey mass of several games sticking together that I can't really seperate: Napishtim, Kefin, Felghana, and Dawn. I'm pretty sure that Origin will be in that as well. And then Seven and Memories of Celceta. ",Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,

"Playing **Outward (PS4)** at the minute and I'm honestly quite surprised at how much I'm enjoying it following a lukewarm first impression.

This game wears its traditional RPG credentials on its sleeve and it's got a kind of jank that somehow only adds to the experience. It scratches the same itch as games like Elex, Risen or Technomancer; deep, ambitious open worlds that seem to inspire a real sense of awe and adventure despite their lack of AAA polish.

I picked it up on a whim after getting bored 20 hours into **Far Cry 6**. Playing Ubisoft titles has become a predictable experience for me. I start off wide-eyed and impressed, and then as soon as I've got the gameplay loop sussed out my excitement wanes. I think the last Ubi title I finished was AC: Odyssey, and that took me several 'legs' of playing over the course of two years. I loved the story, but the burnout in Ubi titles is *real*.

I don't feel like I'm going to get the same burnout in Outward. It delivers that same level of anticipation and ""what's around that corner?"", ""what's in this cave?"", ""what's in that chest"" as something like Divinity OS:2. You just want to play on and explore, loot, craft, find new recipes etc.

I'm not going to review the game here, but one amazing feature of Outward is that, when you die (which you will at the beginning, a lot), you don't just get a game over screen with a reload prompt. The narrative carries on. Get offed in a bandit camp? Uh-oh, the bandits have now captured you and thrown you in prison. Where's your stuff? How do you get out? Deal with it. It makes moment-to-moment gameplay feel more exhilarating knowing that you have to live with the consequences of your actions, and you'll think twice about running headlong into a group of tough-looking baddies.

If you like the RPGs of yesteryear like Morrowind, or you dig Piranha Bytes or Spiders games like Elex or Greedfall, I'd honestly give this a look. The beginning of the game is quite slow and there's a pretty steep learning curve, but it's rewarding as heck once you get going. ",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,
"**Far Cry 6**

I have always enjoyed the far cry games. They are like a comfort food to me. Every far cry game is based on the same enjoyable gameplay pattern of missions, exploration, base capture and general screwing around. It's very relaxing to lose yourself in the open work while listening to the radio in a car. Far Cry 6s Caribbean/latin american music is very calming to listen to. I am so glad this game released when it did. New games aren't coming out nearly as often as they did. ",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,
"**Muv-Luv Alternative**

I played through Extra and Unlimited already. This Muv-Luv experience is my first time playing an actual visual novel. Though I find it to be more of something like a combination of a book and an anime. Alternative has been so linear that there's not much in terms interactivity outside of pressing a button to advance text. I'm maybe half-way through the thing, I'd imagine. I just recently hit a point in the story that was this insane back and forth of screaming into a pillow and then turning on the waterworks, then scream again, waterworks, scream, waterworks... It was cool. I'd say slogging through Extra and playing through the okish Unlimited was worth it. It has what I came here for: The sweet, sweet despair. ",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,
"**The Riftbreaker**

I think it's a really cool game. Very addicting and there's a lot of stuff in it. The base building, the Diablo / Helldivers esque gameplay, tech trees, various weapons, upgrades, weapon mods, abilities etc. There's a lot to this game. That being said I've put about 10 hours into it now and the game's losing steam a little bit. I still haven't build the rift to Earth but I've set up outposts to other biomes and I'm starting to worry like I've seen most of what the game has to offer at this point. I think my biggest issue is that the game hasn't been particularly challenging. I chose the Hard difficulty so maybe I should have gone with highest difficulty setting instead. Holding against enemy attacks is quite easy when you just go fight the swarms yourself. Since you can instantly travel around the map by placing rifts, I don't really have to worry about my defenses so much. I highly recommend it though particularly since it's on gamepass and it's only like 20 dollars or something if you wanna buy it.

"Finally finished **AC Odyssey**. Just an incredible experience. I don't think I've put 120 hours into another single player game except maybe Skyrim many years ago. Didn't even check playtime till I was 60 hours in which is 10 hours more than what I put into Origins and that started feeling like a drag hours before that. Never happened with this though. Finished most missions, all gold ones + some others I stumbled upon. DLC was great with very few gripes. For the ~15 bucks I paid for it, it's some incredible value. Music was great like pretty much every Ubisoft game(highlights being the cult theme, Legend of the Eagle Bearer, Conflict at Seas, One Eyed Monster), graphics as well even far from ultra. 

Really great that it gave you lots of options on how to play it. Like the three different 'classes' felt different and all played great. Somehow combat felt a bit worse than Fenyx Rising, but still very good. I mostly used assassin, only taking some passives from the other threes, but it was so much better than the talents in Origins. The stealth especially felt much better. Mastery to sink talent points was great as well if you didn't want to become a jack of all trades. Other things like being able to ask your quest giver questions for directions/descriptions gave you the option of playing more like older RPGs before quest markers or arrows pointing you in the right direction or you could always just use Ikaros to scan for targets and play it like modern games. Loads of decision making in quests/answers that affected how things played out, but from what I've seen they rarely altered the ultimate outcome in significant ways. Enjoyed the story, but the fact that story missions are level gated really made it difficult to feel coherent. Thankfully I was overleveled fairly soon so didn't really have to wait to further the story. 

Exploration was fun and felt worthwhile, you'd always find something good. When I saw the map for the first time I was afraid it would be a Just Cause situation where there's a lot of water, but not much to do in it. But luckily sea battles were great, almost on the level of Black Flag, and there were underwater ruins to loot good items and cosmetic stuff for your ship. Quests also did a great job of taking you all around the map, which sometimes felt like a pain in the ass if it sent you into a cave that you already explored before. Luckily you could loot quest items even if not on the quest and just auto complete them as you got it. Most of the time at least. 

There were few cutscenes, which is understandable considering how the conversations were more interactive than ever before. Still, after the great cutscenes in Origins this was a bit of a let down. 

The Cultist and Mercenary systems were great additions. Wish they could've made the latter more like Nemesis system in LotR games. I know they can't for patent reasons, but at least if some mercenaries would've survived fights somehow and came back with scars and tougher immunities, it would've been great. 

Loved that it leaned much more into mythology than Origins. Going around fighting mythological beasts and meeting gods/legends was fantastic. Boss battles could've been better, they just felt very Dark Souls lite. 

Was excited for conquest battles, hoping they would be varied and something like the big battles in Viking Battle for Asgard. Unfortunately that didn't happen. Still a good source of XP, money and loot, but you didn't really need to do them and it was irrelevant who controlled which zone. 

The ainigmata ostraka, which were this games version of the papyrus puzzles/london mysteries/nostradamus enigmas from previous games, were very disappointing. Very few of them were actually fun to do, most of them being pretty clear directions to find stuff. Rewards were lackluster too. Compared to the papyrus puzzles in Origins they were terrible. Looks like, for me at least, they alternate in quality between games so here's hoping Valhalla's version will be better. ",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,
"**Shin Megami Tensei: Persona**

This game is a fascinating mess. The story is interesting but a little under developed (though I love how blunt the main cast is). You can easily see the echoes of it in future games in both Persona and SMT (Nocturne practically reused this game's opening, the Snow Queen Quest sets up the true antagonist for P3, etc).

Structurally the game is a pretty straight forward dungeon crawl but it does have an interesting situation where their is an entire second campaign that can be played if you explore the school enough after you finish the first dungeon. This will trigger the Snow Queen Quest and will completely lock you out of the main campaign. I actually did this on accident and I didn't find out what I had done until I looked up a guide because I had gotten lost in a dungeon. While that is really cool I do have some problems with this games structure, most notably some of its blatant padding. Having the boss teleport you out of the dungeon the first time you get to her is cute but having no changes to the dungeon (and having that dungeon be a nightmare maze to navigate) to get to her again is just annoying.

Mechanically the game is annoyingly finicky. The combat system is neat with how you can choose how you want to position your team but there is a very obvious optimal layout you will find as soon as you get your first bow for Maki. It also has a tendency to force you to skip a character's action because an enemy is one pixel out of range of them and immune to whatever magic you have currently equipped to that character. This wouldn't be too bad if experience wasn't distributed based on how much each character accomplished during the fight. This can result in slower characters or character's with awkward ranges falling half a dozen levels behind the party if you are not careful and require you to spend time grinding them up individually if you don't want them to be dead weight. Speaking of the leveling system why did the game feel the need to add three types of exp per character? It just makes grinding them up even more of an annoying balancing act.

Finally the dungeon design in this game is evil. One way hallways, damage floors, blind drops, and giant mazes of completely identical corridors await you if you play the game. The map system is robust enough to get you through if you want to do enough trial and error but I very much suggest using a guide for the later dungeons (especially the Snow Queen dungeons since they are on time limits and don't have save points).

Overall despite all my bitching I really do like the game, it just isn't one I would suggest unless you really like old school JRPGs. ",Positive,Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,

Still very early in the game, cause I just got it yesterday. Boy am I glad I did though. I played some super Metroid on NSO in anticipation of this, and had a really hard time getting into that game.

That being said, Dread felt effortless to pick up and the controls and animations are absolutely top notch. The first boss was a nice challenge and felt super rewarding to beat after many failed attempts. It's also such a beautiful game. The atmosphere is on point, which is exactly what you'd expect from a Metroid game.

I heard some very mixed things and the EMMI sections but I have no issue with them so far. I really enjoy the combination of stealth and running through their lair like a madwoman.

"**Satisfactory**

After Factorio didn't work out, I went back to Satisfactory. I wasn't sure if I should wait for the next update or not, but in the end just started a new game with some mods. 

I'm still relatively early, having just unlocked steel production and will set that up soon.

While I'd already doing some re-building to make it better, it's only been some simple production lines so far. Since I know more or less what to expect later, I hope what I build now is upgradeable enough or modular enough, so I don't have to destroy everything again. Also I never really used most of the transportation options in the past, basically only conveyor belts everywhere. Now that I'm a bit more experienced with those from other games it should work out (knocking on wood).

One thing that might throw a wrench in those plans might be all the collectibles (mainly alternate recipes) that I'm missing, compared to before. Some of the mods I'm using might help with that later on, just to get around a bit quicker.

Most of the mods are more QoL stuff, like more information about your power or productivity, bulk building of foundations, things like that. One straight up just disables fall damage though. I constantly build floating foundations for all my buildings, so I get really anxious about falling off all of the time, even if I could just collect my stuff again right away. There's also a Power Suit mod, where you can add different modules to do different stuff, but I haven't unlocked it yet and never really looked at what those modules can do exactly.

After Dyson Sphere Program, I thought I'd give this another shot. I never really got into it, either during early access or after 1.0 release. After my time with other games like this (Satisfactory or DSP) I thought it might be different this time (it wasn't). My plan was to get to the drones, thinking maybe some kind of logistics system would keep me playing. While I did unlock the drones, I didn't build them and in the end I decided the game is too complex for me to really have fun (at least currently). Satisfactory had similar issues in the ""late game,"" although I might be able to manage now.

Pants were shat, tears were shed, but I did the thing and it's finally over

Overall it's mostly just as good as the base game, with some caveats.

>!A lot of the same eureka and ""HOLY SHIT"" moments are still there, what I wasn't a fan of were the stealth/horror sequences. Besides the fact that I'm a huge pussy irl, the sequences themselves are just annoying cause everything is so damn DARK that its hard to get your bearings (until you learn a certain something way later on). Like sure, maybe that was the point, but the shift from the game's unique sense of cosmic horror to just straight horror is a little disappointing. The reduced frights option does jack btw cause most of the horror comes from how dark everything is+the owl hunters who will still jump scare you at the most random times.!<

Still mostly pretty happy with the dlc, and its a good complement to the base game's story/themes.

If you had a hard time with the >!anglerfish!< from the first game  the DLC is like, 10x worse imo, so beware. ",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Positive,
"**Crysis 2 Remaster (PS5)**

I was looking for a SP shooter to play and didn't bite the bullet with Far Cry 6 due to its mixed reviews, but then I saw Digital Foundry's vid on these games and I was all in. Played the first game in those nostalgic High School days when me and some friends managed to scrape by with our custom built PC's. WoW, Supreme Commander 2, Crysis...good times. Played and beat the first game back in the day and played parts of Crysis 2 on my Xbox360 but never did beat it. A lot of players *really* liked Crysis 2 judging from the reviews I read, so Im excited to be playing it again.

It's holds up great! This game nails gunplay. Particle effects are top notch with smoke puffs, blood, and sparks flying out as you light up enemies. The gun sounds are punchy and satisfying. The A.I. might be dumb, but it can lead to some hilarious moments with physics and throwable objects. There are multiple stealth kill animations for the different enemy types. There are two enemy factions so you get those gameplay scenarios where the AI will clash with eachother while you get to play around them, which gives me those lovely Half-Life vibes.

Some cons are that you can't customize your pad controls and there's no Bumper Jumper set up (so sad) and the controller sensitivity options are lackluster. I was able to get used to what's there but it definitely sucks that it's so limited. ",Positive,Negative,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,

Still probably my favorite FPS game I've played, leopard attacks aside. 

Obviously I can't recommend it enough. This version (Classic Edition) is seven years old, but it barely feels like it. Many of the mechanics in this game are superior to the ones in Far Cry 6. The biggest flaw in Far Cry 3 for me will always be the vehicles, they drive like absolute dogshit. I spend a lot of time in vehicles in Far Cry 6 but I basically ignore them in Far Cry 3 and hoof it everywhere.

I've now beaten it twice. First run on normal mode was 7:30 with 90% completion. Second run was on hard mode - 4:00:31 with ~50% completion. I'm so bummed I missed out on the special ending reward by *thirty one seconds.* I might be able to reach it if I clean up the final boss kill a bit.

Overall I think it's a fantastic game. It's one of the best feeling games in the genre ever, IMO. Controlling Samus feels so good, and combat is a ton of fun. The game does a fantastic job of maintaining a sense of forward momentum with the upgrades. You're getting a new upgrade every 20-30 minutes in a normal playthrough.

I found the map as a whole to be a bit lackluster. The actual exploration side of things felt great. But the individual zones/maps don't have that strong of an identity in my opinion. Grab a couple screenshots of random rooms and I doubt I'd be able to tell you which zone they're in, even though I've played it 2x at this point. It doesn't help that you're constantly traveling/teleporting to different zones, which makes it a bit discombobulating.

It is finally here! Yesterday Gloomhaven finally got out of its early access state and added the full tabletop campaign. We've been playing it with couple of friends for two days now, about 5-6h played and so far really liking it.

We had already tried the game out on Tabletop Simulator long time ago after hearing overwhelming praise towards the game. And it was great fun, but it was just hard to get 3 others to have a go at it (also, some of the TTS stuff is clunky to use. Alright, but clunky).

The game is a blast. I ordinarily don't give a rat's ass about combat in tabletop games, but somehow the combat in Gloomhaven is really compelling. Turns when you have 100% comfortable with the cards you pick are rare and situations almost always chance when enemies and your teammates play their turn. Combine that with sometimes not-so-useful battle-goals and soft turn limit with your cards burning down on every rest, it is really tightly woven game. Leveling up and new items are also joy to get, as are perks.

"I've been playing **Watch Dogs** recently, currently in the middle of Act 2. It's been a few years since I've really gotten into an Ubisoft open world, so the formula has actually been entertaining enough for a while. I did most of the investigation puzzles and unlocked all the towers, which were a nice change of pace. The hacking gameplay is cool and feels super satisfying when things just line up perfectly, but often also ends up a bit janky to control and too limited, not really utilizing its full potential. I hope they improved on that in the sequels.

The campaign missions have been very fun so far overall and I'm enjoying the story, even though the writing is rather mediocre and the pacing feels all over the place, but I find it entertaining nonetheless. The side missions on the other hand are downright awful, no substance, very repetitive and frustratingly bad designed, not least due to the terrible checkpoint system. I really need to rant about this for a bit.

My ""favorite"" so far has been one of the DLC missions, The Palace, where you have to get onto a mansion grounds full of police, hack into a computer.. and while the cutscene afterwards is still playing, another ton of enemies spawn, one of them right behind me. Meanwhile you're *supposed* to chase after an important NPC who drives away in their car. If you can't stumble past all the new enemies fast enough to follow them - and if you don't get shot immediately after regaining control like I was - its Mission Failed and you're restarting from the very beginning.

Or more recently, I tried to do the bonus mission you get for completing the Weapons Trade investigations. First you need to infiltrate a warehouse full of enemies. After that, the game tells you to prepare for reinforcements - but it *doesn't* give you any indication where they're supposed to come from (the warehouse is basically an open field) and after ten seconds maximum, they already arrive. After that a *second* wave arrives, again, with no indicators or actual time to prepare anything. I die aaand restart from the top. Yeah, no thanks game, you can keep your crap.

It's particularly bizarre because the main missions *have* had solid checkpoints from what I've seen so far. But then again, they generally feel infinitely more polished in comparison, even though it all utilizes the same gameplay mechanics. It's like they either just didn't bother putting as much effort into the side content, or it was done by a different team who had no idea how good game design works. Maybe both.

I've been playing this again since the Lay D Denton Project was announced. The mod is very well done, very thorough. The mod was one reason I replayed this, but I was also curious how well the game has held up. As pretty much anyone who grew up with PC games in the 90s and early 00s I played this game a bunch. I think the story has held up pretty well. There's a lot more political thriller-ish elements than I remembered. It's also kind of weird to play now since it's, spoiler warning, about a government using a man-made plague to install themselves in positions of global power. Feels very timely in terms of actual conspiracy theories about the recent still-ongoing pandemic. The gameplay is generally fine, but stealth is extremely buggy. Sometimes enemy soldiers won't sense your presence as you're sprint right in front of their eyes, and other times you'll alert every single guard in the vicinity because reasons. The levels have a lot of ways to approach the objectives, although you'll fairly quickly be kind of a jack of all traits, hacking your way through security one minute and then headshotting everyone the next. What I mean is that the gameplay and the available skills don't really facility a whole lot of distinct ways to play the game. Curious to check out the Revision mod.

The sound design is really great in a ton of ways, footsteps are very audible and  the AI communicate in real time calling out your last known location to one another with precious to detail, ""he's behind the chair"". 

Speaking of the AI they did a really good job making them feel dynamic and challenging to fight, always acting as a squad and trying to use tactics such as pincer movements to bring you down. 

The gunplay also feels better than most modern shooters in a variety of ways. Guns feels heavy and impactful as they slam into bodies and shatter objects and walls. The slow mode mechanic avalible really compliments the experience, adding another dimension to the gunplay. All weapons ive used so far, from the pistol to a rifle that empales your enemies on walls and my personal fav the shotgun, that often turns your foes to red mist are all viable and super fun to use. 

Some of the horror elements still feel genuinely scared and tense to date, I often find myself on the edge of my seat as I'm moving through a dark area with a fading flashlight.

"I've been playing Lemnis Gate with game pass. It's a time-looping FPS and I'm having a lot of fun with it, but seems like nobody is playing. I think it has potential, but I guess there's been no marketing for it and it's a niche genre. ",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,
"I played a bit more **[Red Dead Online](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadonline/)**, and encountered my first 2 hackers (a couple days apart, and not a huge issue since I could just join a new session), but outside of that it's been enjoyable.  Slowly chugging through the gold grind, I'm nearing 8 now, and jumping on the bounty hunting asap.

"**[The Riftbreaker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/780310/The_Riftbreaker/)** came out this week, and I am absolutely loving it.  It's everything I love about Factorio, but simplified down, and it's a really fun game.  There's a lot to get through, a huge tech tree, lots of items to build, the swarms are super huge, and the game runs really well (for the most part).  There are some performance issues, where the game just slows down, it doesn't drop frames or anything, just goes slow motion, and I only noticed it after placing a shitload of mine towers that cover their radius with landmines.

I've played for about 10 hours so far, and only just started going to other zones, so there's a boatload of content, with a lot more for me to explore.  There's a large variety of weapons, and with you having a left & right arm to equip, that means you can dual-wield melee weapons, or ranged weapons, and it's a blast.  Just going around with 2 miniguns blasting for about 30 seconds before running completely out of ammo is so much fun.

**Little mini update about Riftbreaker:** There are some super important tips in the loading tips, which aren't really mentioned anywhere else in the game I can find (no tips page in the pause menu, or anything).  One of them being that the higher-tier miners don't mine more ore faster, they just flat out mine more ore.  So a tier 1 miner will mine all 1000 ore from a node, and give you 1000 ore, whereas a tier 3 will mine all 1000 ore from a node, but give you 3000.  The other being that you can hold Alt while placing a building to instantly place the highest tier that you've unlocked, so instead of placing a tier 1 miner, waiting for it to build, it mines some more before you can upgrade it to tier 2, repeat for tier 3, you can just instantly put tier 3 miners down, and it only takes as long as the largest upgrade.  Would love for them to add a kind of help page or something in the pause menu somewhere, since these tips are super useful, and you can go a long time without a load screen.

Definitely recommend this game, and I can see it being so much more fun with coop being added eventually. ",Positive,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Negative,
"Came to the end (for the moment) of my **[New World](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063730/New_World/)** experience.  I hit 55 and I've just been getting more and more frustrated with the game, and with a few new games coming out I've not really missed not playing it.

While waiting for transfers to be a thing (they said they expected them last week, then this week, and now they've been pushed to next week, which I don't really trust), I managed to hit the point where the honeymoon period for the game was over.

I finished the main quest and (spoilers will be tagged) the end of it is just super sudden, it feels like they just hard stopped working on it.  It's not a case of ""oh they expect more content so it's a bit of a ""the story will continue"""", it just stops suddenly.  >!You help some animals by doing some quests, then you have to fight a level 60 elite, which we had to zerg down as a 10 man (it has no indicator other than the mob that it'll be a group quest), after that you visit 2 locations and then it just stops, ""here's your T5 Azoth staff"" (which doesn't work by the way), and that's it?  It felt super bad.!<

Other than that the side quests were just slowly grinding me down, constantly sending me back to the same spot that I just went to to kill another 20 mobs (they started MASSIVELY increasing what you need to do for side quests later on), and the worst part is they give next to no experience.  I get more xp by interacting with the town board & turning materials in, it doesn't feel like it should be like that at all.

The bugs are also insane, some of the endgame content is just hard locked because an item you need doesn't work.  The T5 Azoth staff you get cannot close the T5 Azoth staff required corrupted portals, it just does not work, and that's a fairly large bit of the endgame.  Outside from the Wars & Invasions (the former of which you can't join unless you're max level, or part of the company instigating/defending, and the latter of which you can't join unless you're max level, and if you do manage to be one of the 40 random people picked, chances are the company who owns the region will abuse a bug to kick you out & get their own players in), there's 2 level 60 dungeons, which you can't really enter, since you need to complete the open-world endgame content, T5 corrupted areas.  They don't work because your staff cannot interact with them to close them.  Amazon has put out a couple of patches, both of which had extremely long downtime (they both went for over twice the length of the estimated time, so that was fun), and some of the things they ""fixed"" just didn't get fixed at all, it's a joke.

Definitely stay far far away from this game for a long time, and at that point the playerbase will probably have dwindled away anyway, which stops a bunch of the content from being available.  It's a real shame since I was super excited for this game, but it just screwed so many things up in so many different ways.

"# There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension

Just started tackling the 4th chapter, and so far the overall experience has been consistently great. It's a comedic adventure game, and it's fantastic. Voice acting is particularly on point.

"# Bloons TD 6

Late to the party, but, long story short, it's a perfectly competent tower defense game. It's not the most populated genre, I feel, so getting to see and play a good TD game is something that I appreciate quite a bit... but damn, it's so full of bullshit. 

The way the game is designed to constantly push its playerbase towards spending money to buy experience, in-game currency, heroes, and power-ups is immensely off-putting. Honestly, I should probably just ditch it and get, say, Creeper World 4 during one of the upcoming sales. We'll see. ",Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,
"# Obsidian Prince

Didn't jive with me, this one. It looks amazingly cozy and it's very mellow in general, but for now it's not a particularly fun experience. 

The humour is deeply hit or miss (and whatever it was, it wasn't a hit for me, although I can't say I outright loathed the game's silliness), and just about everything about the game's overworld layer made me wonder if the whole thing even needed to be there (although it certainly serves to create the aforementioned cozy atmosphere, I'll give it that). Combat is good (turn-based, tactical), but an hour and a half in it started feeling a touch stale.

Then we have the deck building component, which is actually pretty curious, at least on the conceptual level. Two decks are in play, one for inspirations and one for backstories. Three inspirations are drawn each turn, granting various bonuses ranging from unconditional, but minor damage boosts to things that heftily alter the way certain abilities work. All of them are discarded once your turn is over, and a new trio is drawn. Backstories are drawn upon entering a new dungeon room, and they stay with you until the next combat encounter; their effects provide either passive bonuses or one-time boons such as HP/energy/armour restoration.

Again, I definitely appreciate the concept, yet its execution didn't feel great somehow. Inspirations come and go far too rapidly, even though in the end they certainly have impact, and I'm not sure if backstories' relative lack of permanence is the way to go. More importantly, not much is offered in terms of exerting control over these decks, the way it felt to me. There are also passive skills you get to develop whenever your character levels up, but nothing about this system felt intriguing.

Obsidian Prince is still in early access, so I don't feel the need to write it off here and now, especially given that the game's foundation isn't too shaky, but for now it's just not there yet.",Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,
"**Dead Space \[PC\]**

First time playing Dead Space; didn't have a console or PC when it originally came out and it took me awhile to get around to it. Spooky month seemed as good a time as any.

Starting to show its age a bit, but holds up surprisingly well. The controls felt a bit stiff at first, but that was coming off a bunch of other third person action games I've played in the past year during quarantine, I think I just needed to get back into the survival horror mindset. In that regards, I was a bit surprised to find it more in the vein of Resident Evil 4 than Resident Evil 1-3, etc. It all really works well though once I actually figured out where the game was coming from and adjusted.

Playing on normal there's a plethora of resources and my cautious play sees a stockpile of health and ammo in storage. Despite this though, the game keeps up a sense of dread and in between stores I never felt totally at ease with my supplies. Frequently selling excess health and ammo stacks to buy more power nodes for better upgrades, I've gone all in on the Cutter (RE4 instilled in me the idea of upgrading your reliable starter pistol) and the Ripper. The cutter is mostly for distance and fallback, I don't see why anyone bothers with any other weapons when the ripper exists. Once you max out distance, damage, and reload, you don't even need to bother with the capacity if you don't want to. Top it with some heavy investment in cryostasis and I just freeze anything that makes me panic and then go to town. It's my security weapon, the one I enter every room with.

The design is very competent, the game has good flow and never stagnates. The variety of necromorphs is very much appreciated and they continue to add new types even late into the game. You'll often meet encounters in areas you've already cleared when doubling back which means you never feel entirely safe or secure. It's occasionally very clever in the way it frames things, too. I'm at the point where I've just returned to the Ishimura from the Valor and the first thing you see is one of those fast necromorphs letting you know they've come aboard and no, of course you're not done with them. In other ways though it can play its hand too heavy and things have stopped being surprising. Look, I'm not saying I don't still jump when I get attacked from behind, but towards the end of the game entering certain large rooms or seeing hallways with strategically placed vents telegraphs things pretty well. Can't tell if this was done on purpose and while it's nice to feel savvy predicting these things, it can also make them a little rote. Still, not deducting points here.

I played a bit of Dead Space 2 on a friend's PC years back and I already own it on Steam, so I'm looking forward to digging into that, though maybe not right after this. Still undecided on if I'll even bother with the third?",Positive,Negative,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,
"**Ys: The Oath in Felghana**

I started this after feeling very meh about Tokyo Xanadu. As with Origin, I do love how this game FEELS, but I have some issues with it, namingly how leveling up one time can somehow change the entire game, and how you're never just right level-wise by just going through the dungeon and fighting everything once. It basically always requires some slight grinding, which I wouldn't mind so much if not for my second big issue: just how goddamn easy it is to die and have to start at the beginning of the dungeon because the save points are so infrequent. It's really demoralizing when you get basically right to the save point, but because you got unlucky with monster drops and ate shit once or twice, you have to repeat the entire thing over. This isn't some Dark Souls shit where you can just run past everything you've gone through, as mentioned you need that XP you lost, and even when killing everything it's still probably not enough for the bosses. 

Anyway, that's my biggest issue with the game. Putting my playthrough on pause for now because of that frustration.",Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,

I opted to continue my spooky game binge after SH4, and bought the first 3 of these from PSN before sony makes buying on PS3 difficult. This one was interesting. I wouldn't say it's aged as well as RE1 or SH1 as a first entry, but I appreciate this one being a little different in focus. Unfortunately, one of those differences (the actual Camera you use to kill ghosts) is cumbersome to deal with between the ghosts popping in and out constantly before I can get any shot in, and having to run the hell away after that failure. Really hope they improve that in the sequels, because we've got a good concept here. In any case, gonna have another break from spooky games before the next one.

"I finally sat down to sink a bit of time into **Back 4 Blood** and I just love the old school Left 4 Dead vibes it gives me.

Its defo one of those whereby if you loved left 4 dead you'll love this and if you hated it well its sadly more of the same.    
The card/deck element is quite a nice touch to add stats boosts and buffs as well as the corruption cards which make the enemies even harder, giving them some buffs and even armor. A good bit of teamwork on this game goes a long way and does make the game a lot more enjoyable but that being said I have found that the AI is honestly quite helpful as well much to my surprise.

Just finished it after around 9 hours. Gameplay was pretty easy, but the atmosphere and limited resources made me feel tense about every move I made.

I was also worried the little brother will turn the game into annoying escort mission, but he turned out to be more obedient than most kids I know in real life. I'm gonna play the sequel for sure.

"At home, I've been struggling through **Deathloop**.  Its a super hard game to love (for me at least).  It has the most convoluted menu/mission/gameplay rules I've seen in years, especially from a major and mature game studio. Its hard to describe how badly its learning curve makes it feel unplayable at times. 

I've finally, after some 25 hours or so, started to make some progress, and I can start to see where its going.  I've come close to rage quitting it a couple of times, which is something I haven't felt like doing in many many years.  

The gameplay though is actually fun, and basic writing, snarky NPCs, main character scripted lines and voice acting is whimsical and amusing.  The guns are really solid, the set designs and artwork are amazing (per Arkane), and once engaged in a mission (if you can actually figure out how to actually do that), its hard to stop playing until you complete an entire area.

The story concept is hard enough to get your head around...  it is super original and creative, but gets buried in its own desire to be original and creative.   I'm determined to complete it, at least with one character.   Its too bad, as it has so much potential, but is dragged down by basic gaming problems that could have been avoided with some simple different design decisions.   The core gaming ideas of figuring out what missions you're supposed to do, what your stuff/loadout is, how to find it, where to go...  its just terrible and confusing.

And the basic rules about the world make it even harder to get comfortable with the whole permadeath thing that you experience in the first few tries at the game.   But will keep on grinding my way through it to see where I come out.... ",Neutral,Positive,Positive,Negative,Neutral,
"Far Cry 6

Honestly didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d enjoy this at all. After hating 5 with a passion and swearing off the series like every other Ubisoft IP, I figured 6 would be just as bad. But I decided to try it through PS5 game sharing after seeing and hearing my friends play. If itâ€™s free, why not?

And I can honestly say itâ€™s not bad. In some ways it feels like a return to older Far Cry games, and it made massive improvements to the story aspect. My character finally feels like a real character again, or maybe even for the first time. Feels like they really have a personality, and the little things like singing to music in the car are a nice touch. Iâ€™m thankful they fixed the stealth too. I remember playing 5 and it felt like you literally couldnâ€™t do stealth. Weapons like silenced snipers and bows were pointless because a single shot would alert an entire base and theyâ€™d just know where you were. 6 fixed that and now I can actually be stealthy again.

But thatâ€™s not to say I think the game is very good. Itâ€™s fine, itâ€™s a quality I expect from the series and Ubisoft as a whole, but not one I am impressed by at all. I often look at the game and have the feeling that it resembles a remastered game from years ago. Visually itâ€™s just not impressive, but itâ€™s fine enough.

I have other gripes with it, like skills being tied to armor pieces instead of a skill tree I can eventually unlock completely. Unlocking new weapons randomly through crates or slowly through vendor purchases is dumb. To mimic something I saw someone else say and agree with, the games tone is all over the place. I hate the wackiness the series has adopted, like pet alligators you can fight with. And the truly serious moments donâ€™t hit as hard because of things like that. You can have serious stuff, and not serious stuff. But it has to be balanced and executed in the right way, and this is not it at all. And the parkour/climbing system is fuckin ass. I can only climb over waist high things or things slightly taller than me. Anything else in between or in a spot the devs donâ€™t like is impossible. I often find myself struggling to get around certain things because itâ€™s not a height the game likes. It needs serious work. And thereâ€™s plenty of other little things that are annoying or just half assed. Oh, and just like everyone else says about this game, the ai enemy spawn needs to be fixed badly.

Overall though Iâ€™m enjoying my time with it, and I didnâ€™t expect to. Ubisoft still has a long way to go if theyâ€™re going to make a truly great game. Iâ€™ve yet to feel like this series has made a jump in quality the same way FC3 did compared to 2. ",Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,

Why not make bosses one hit kill too? How come samus can survive like 30 massive scorpion tails to the face but a robot grappling her is too much?

"I finally got to playing Shadow of the Colossus (PS4 remake), a game I got as a gift years ago for my birthday. Shortened verdict: Absolute trash. 

Long verdict, because I feel like ranting: Bluepoint clearly did a great job recreating the game from the original, based on screenshots and gameplay I've seen of the PS2 version in comparison to the PS4 one. They made an extremely beautiful, vibrant environment, full kudos to them. The game, however, should not have been recreated in the first place. 

As I reached the final boss, my biggest fear was that the final boss may be The Camera Itself, a colossal camera representing the worst challenge of the previous ones. I turned out to be right, the final boss being suspiciously close to the shape of a photographic lens, and The Camera being at its worst, this entity that indeed be the biggest evil of that world. 

Anyway, the gameplay - a lot of the mechanics to repeat a boss are a repeat of a single action multiple times (i.e. find a way to bring it down, then hurt it badly, it throws you off, do it again) which I found uninspired. Some were better, with different weakpoints requiring a different approach, but those were far and few between... and that is heavily affected by the controls, which are worse than any mechanic in the game. The result is a game that looks -extremely epic- but feels -extremely bad-. And the final weigh in is heavily on the bad feeling. I am really sad about the people who bought it for me for full price (i.e. my friends who got it as a gift for me), as this is not the type of game I wish I had any role in supporting. 

I won't even get started on the story. I went to see if there was a way I could affect it, the ending particularly (not that I would, no way I am -ever- playing that game again) but of course, there is nothing like it. I saw a lot of people saying the ending made them feel deeply and will stay with them for a long time... not me. Being railroaded throughout a story I know almost nothing about in terms of background, to then be given a minute where I can do nothing and just watch my fate helpless? Great storytelling, leave it for a book or a movie, if you'll let me have some sort of impact in my final moments, actually let me do that. 

On the positive side of things, I got such a bad impression of this game, that it made me feel better about RE8 that I finished just some days before it, though I still think it is not a game that holds up to the standards we should have in 2021 for first person games.

Next on my list is to (possibly, maybe, we'll see) manage to finish Sekiro, and that around a month of active WoW subscription should keep me busy enough until Black Friday when I am hoping to score Wasteland 3 and a few other goodies I am looking forward to playing. In the meantime: Don't play Shadow of the Colossus, some things should stay in the past. ",Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Neutral,

"**Tales of Arise**

Going in I was wary of all of the MTX, and I know myself personally that JRPGs burn me out partway through playthroughs so I expected this to happen (And it did). So I waited a bit to play this

**The Start:**

* The writing (At first) was fantastic. It was engaging, dark, full of mystery (And answers exist! Good, if not great answers! To almost everything!)
* The combat was fast paced and felt satisfying with cool looking Bursts, fun dialog that was changing as my relationships increased
* Multiple forms of progression sated my need for those systems (At first). Levels, Titles (Basically talents that can be purchased after unlocking them by doing something, be it cooking a kind of food or doing a certain quest)
* Incredibly well-done characters, each of them I wanted to listen to more and more. (I thought Law's backstory was a bit weird and dull, but I still liked Law, especially in combat)

**After the 3rd Lord, things started feeling ""More of the same"".**

* Mechanics stopped getting introduced. In JRPGs, this tends to start my ""JRPG Burnout""
* Character development was largely a loop. It was like a cycle of ""This offends me"" - ""I have overcome this"" - ""This offends me again"". It was almost as if very dynamic characters became very static
* The areas started feeling MUCH less complete. Zones still beautiful, but not as utilized as before.
* This is also when combat burnout started. As I said, mechanics stopped getting introduced.

1. Skills from Titles largely started falling flat for me.
2. Leveling up ended up feeling like a redundant system that just checked your level relative to the enemy's level. No stat allocation, etc
3. The enemy types stopped getting introduced. Everything I had seen before and it was getting copy pasted

Overall, I was still having fun, but I feel in hindsight this was due to not seeing the problems yet, or assuming they were temporary and the game will get back on track.

**Then by the 5th Lord,** things started feeling obviously incomplete:

* Dungeons that used to teleport you out or loop you back to the entrance would now end and the next quest would say ""Go back to the entrance"" and it locks your fast travel, so you have to backtrack all of what you just did.
* A massive, beautifully designed city hardly utilized, largely due to what felt like no plotline there and straight to the Lord
* >!The 5th Lord felt very unfinished. It's also like they initially planned for him to be some huge rival and opposite of the protagonist, but it just seemed more-so random and shoved in last moment in development by teasing him in the 2nd and 3rd area through quick and random scenes)!<

I'm going to mark the this section as spoilers because most of it will be.

>!In my opinion, the game should have ended here and I'd still be content and say ""It was kind of rushed near the end, still a pretty good game overall""!<

>!I'm going to do pros/cons here, because if I mix them this will seem mainly very negative and NOT ALL OF THIS SECTION IS BAD. I just wanted to kms getting through it :P!<

**The End**

Pros:

* >!The story kept stringing me along with mystery:!<

1. >!The Red Woman mystery had me hooked. Call me easy, I was curious and it kept me going.!<
2. >!The answers I was looking for the entire time actually had answers. They did create more questions, but they (Rather quickly) get answered as well. Everything had answers (Aside from a billion random plot holes I could come up with, but that didn't bother me). The plot I was mainly very happy with, despite sort of sighing seeing brand new species/main enemies so close to the end.!<
3. >!Characters became SORT OF dynamic again. I say sort of because of a con that's about to come up related to how much dialog this portion of the game had.!<
4. >!The few plot twists near the end landed well with me. Nagging questions I had got answered and I thought they were good answers. I feel like I'm repeating myself there a bit!<

* >!The areas you visit are satisfying to see, and it's like being bombarded with rewards for sitting through the story so far. Lenegis may have been short, but everything from how citizens talked about the Lords, to how they treated Dohalim, to the Forbidden Area being where your flashback was from!<

Cons:

* >!I SAT THROUGH LIKE, 9 HOURS (I kept taking breaks, so it was more like 6 hours) OF GOD DAMN FREAKING DIALOG. I'm not joking, it was around 90-95% dialog. Every time it ended you walked forward 2 steps and it started again. Yes, I listened to all of it, yes I listened to all of the optional dialogs of characters. It was endless. Looping. My friends were walking by near the end of the day asking why I looked so mad, and one of them thought I was watching a TV show all day. Jesus this actually ruined my entire opinion of the game, and it's so unfortunate because I was ready to recommend it to anyone until this section!<
* >!It's even more obvious they ran out of time here. All of the answers bombarded you at once. This was partially very satisfying because at this point I had been wondering the answers for 50 hours of gameplay, but the amount of sheer information thrown at you when you get to the Forbidden Zone and forward is just insane to me. Hell, they give up on cutscenes for a bit and you can just walk around the room and read what was actually going on for yourself!<
* >!The Iron Mask (Which in hindsight was probably moreso a selling-point to make the protagonist distinguishable in marketing) was so lazily explained that it was comical. Honestly a lot of the early plot points with the protagonist seem like marketing wanted X and they shoe-horned in those details to work with their story.!<
* >!5th Lord useage was terrible. Won't get too much into that. Very very cool how they adapted him and his ""Maiden"" after your failed history.  Aside from that, 5th Lord just seemed like a victim of them running out of time and not getting fleshed out enough.!<

Last thing I'm adding in here, the MTX. MTX are one of the most game-affecting parts of game development currently so I find it important to discuss them.

**This is how I believe MTX affected the game:**

* Resource scarcity. Resources are not fun to farm, and you can reduce the cost of things to 1 through MTX to fix the issue
* Gald scarcity (Also a resource, whoops). Gald the entire game is a limited resource and very obviously so. MTX can reduce all vendor prices by a massive %, somewhere between 30-50% I forget. It makes the game much less annoying.
* The worst part: Each character has 4 Skill Trees (Titles) locked behind paid DLC. Even if you don't need them to succeed, they lock abilities you can't use to them unless you pay. It feels shitty.

Is this game worth $60? Absolutely yes. Easily. Did I enjoy it? I enjoyed most of it.

**TLDR;** Tales of Arise started off incredible, and while it's story largely remained it's driving force and hitting for the most part, other parts of the game seemingly fell apart later in due to time constraint issues and it ruined what was a fantastic experience for me.

"Been trying to decide what i think about **Deathloop**.  I'm about 12 hours in, and I can't tell if I like it, love it, dislike it, or hate it (I probably don't hate it).  It has  a pretty cool style, sort of Dishonored meets Bioshock meets Timeshift.  And the gameplay is decent..... I think.  The whole thing so far though has been a head scratching experience.  And I'm not being drawn into it.

It has a painful learning curve, and it took the first 6 or so hours just to figure out what the heck was going on at all.  I'm ok reading some lore, listening to some side conversations from NPCs, etc, but this game painfully inflicts you with limited information to know what is actually happening.  I knew it was a gimicky game going into it, but it feels pretty inaccessible so far.

I typically don't look online when I'm stuck in a game, as I actually still like figuring stuff out on my own.  But the Deathloop experience is so convoluted, I still have almost no idea what is going on so I've actually looked some stuff up online....

I just died completely for the first time, and apparently, I have to start the entire thing over again.  After I died, I had to sit through 5 minutes of popup callouts telling me all the things happening in the game, almost none of which actually made it into my brain.  I still have no idea what's going on, but I guess I'll start again.

Not saying that the gameplay isn't fairly enjoyable as it basically is.  And the setting, visual style, and overall experience while playing is pretty good, but I can't remember the last time I played a fairly polished game and was so lost.  

I can see that Arkane tried really hard to do something super creative and newish.  But the devils in the details and sometimes the minute by minute operation of the game, things like maps, game menus, inventory, mission logs, etc is just super annoying, if you can actually find those things at all.

I'll keep playing until I get bored.  Either I'll finish or I'll walk away.   Bummer so far ",Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Negative,Neutral,

One of the best co op experiences I ever had. A wonderful combination of story, problems solving, stealth, action and it looks great.

"**Ys I Chronicles (PC)**

Absolutely loved it.

The bump combat is ingenious. It creates a great combat flow of being constantly in motion, moving forward. Backtracking, a bane in many games due to the unavoidable encounters along the way, is no concern in his game. You just run right through them. This is also due to the great progession system. Leveling up actually *means something.* Enemies are too strong? Lvl up just once and you're back on top again. Even after you reach the max. lvl of 10, the game still finds ways to keep this pace by giving you new equipment. The compact world and short game length(takes about an afternoon to finish), actually added to the fun. Everything is on point and just as long as it needs to be. No filler content or anything. Character's and story are 80's goodness. Meaning it has a clear cut set up in which the characters are put into.

Great art, both versions of it. But I decided on Complete's version of the art as it's more rougher and characters look more varied. Especially Dark Fact, who looks WAY better in the Complete art version. He looks like fanart of himself in Chronicle art tbh. Speaking of that guy: that bossfight bordered on bullshit, but it was still lots of fun. 

And holy shit the music! I did not expect to actually jam to the music when I played this. An absolute banger soundtrack. I grabbed the complete OST for Chronicles the moment I finished this one. Btw, the back cover of the OST tells that Adol dies at the age of 63. Interesting.

This game is close to perfect for me. It's an example of how to do it right. Short and on point, tight as hell, not dragging for even just a minute, no features or gimmicks the game can't deliver on. ",Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Neutral,
"**Ys II Chronicles (PC)**

Loved it this one as well. But not *quite* as much as the first one. 

Combat is easier due to the diagonal attack and enemies not turning immediately when hit. Even if you attack straight, as long as Adol faces diagonally, you're not taking any damage. Regular combat is absolutely 0 threat in this game. Magic is now a thing, and the Roo Rod is practically the main star of this game. You can turn yourself into a demon and talk to every single enemy in the game, instead of fighting them. And they all have something else to say. No copy pasted lines either. I always love it when games have a section in which you infiltrate the enemy and can walk amongst them unhindered. The Roo Rod is the pinnacle of this. Also making backtracking a breeze as you can just walk past enemies. 

Some of the dungeons have gotten quite labyrinthian. Which is fine on its own, but the game's progression also got quite a bit more nebulous. At some points in the game, not knowing whether you can do something on your own, or whether you have to go find an NPC, and if so, which one and where, made progression a headache when combined with the labyrinthian nature of dungeons. A good bit longer than 1. But most of that was carried by 2 dungeons alone, and figuring out the proper progression.

Loved it. I didn't write a huge post about these two, but Ys Chronicles has rocketed straight into my favourite games of all times list. I love pretty much everything about them. The Chronicles graphics evoke an SNES/PSX era charme, the music is phenomenal, the combat simple but great, the gameflow is top tier and the story is a nice wrap from start to finish. These two games made me a fan.

"**Ys III Oath in Felghana (PC)**

So here we go again. First Ys I ever tried, this time making it through. Liked it a lot, but didn't love it, as Chronicles.

Despite having more mechanics and sytems, also a regular button combat now(I already miss bump combat...), this one feels comparatively ""simple.""
The main reason for this is probably the very linear progression. No more open areas and labyrinths, but corridors and intersections. Which makes sense given the original game was a 2D sidescroller. But that makes it feel more like a platformer with RPG elements than an ARPG like Chronicles. 

Another thing is that there's only one village, compared to I&II this makes the progression a bit more dull for me.
The free save system is gone as well and now we have save points, which is a bit of a let down, because I loved the free saving in Chronicles. It really helped with the flow. In terms of difficulty Oath is definitely a much harder game than Chronicles. I played Chronicles on Hard, and Oath on Normal. Oath was about 10x as tough. Not a bad thing though.

It is undoubtedly a good game that left a strong taste. Already looking forward to Napishtim and Origin. Music is still great, but there's no vocal ending song this time... And a general question: shouldn't magic be gone from the world after the ending of II, as you destroyed the source of magic?

"**Ys IV Memories of Celceta (currently playing, PC)**

Four versions of Ys IV. Two outsourced games in 1993, a PS2 version, and then this one almost 20years later. As this is the canonical one, I decided on this one. But I almost played Dawn because I heard its excellent.

Quite a jump in style from Felghana, in terms of visuals as well as mechanics. Music, at least at this point, is the weakest of the bunch. A lot of times it's just there. Nothing that actively jumps out as great, except for the main menu and opening cinematic. Combat doesn't feel as tight. Not sure if I dare call C's bump combat tight, but Felghana certainly kept you on your toes at all times. This one has weaknesses to different weapons and abilities, blocking, dodging and status effects. But so far, its just standard weed whacking. The Bosses in particular are absolute pushovers, and also quite static.

Dialogue choice is pretty pointless: one proper, and one joke answer. Also a terrible case of meme translation. Including Pokemon jokes? Really XSEED? And the tone feels overly dudebro. Answer choices like ""Damn straight"" and ""You got the wrong guy bub"" from Adol are setting a tone that is not my thing. Some positives now: Team members pick up monster drops. Very nice. The ability to save anytime is back! +1 point. So are open areas instead of just corridors. And the weapon upgrade system is pretty great and actually useful.

To be honest, I'm not feeling this one too much. Where Ys I-III had a very sharp and focused feel to them, that makes them stand out, Ys IV feels a bit like something I played a dozen times already. From the presentation to pacing, the questboard, gathering materials, etc. I'm at the point where I need to go into the ruins to cross the river, after 6hrs or so. It's supposed to be 24hrs long on average so I worry it may mess with my momentum from the first three games.",Negative,Negative,Neutral,Negative,Neutral,
"**Ys IV Dawn of Ys (PC Engine Turbografx)**

Ok as I reached that point with Celceta, I thought what the hell? Lets play Dawn as well. And it was amazing!

First up: the music is amazing right off the bat. The variety of the instruments and styles used, brings me right back to Chronicles. We're back to jamming. The little intro after Adol left for Celceta(not even waiting for Lilia to see him again...) was absolutely great. And the art! It's *chef's kiss* good. I'm sorry to go ""old good! new bad!"" for a second, but if you don't think [this](http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ys4artwork4.jpg) is way more interesting than [this](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/isu/images/b/bd/Guruda.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/403?cb=20131001060636), then you won't get a christmas card this year.

It's interesting to see the same story told in a different way. In this one, Karna isn't from the Treetop village, but a militia member from a nearby village, who's brother got kidnapped and turned into a monster. Duran, likewise, isn't a partner of Adol's but rather a thief belonging to the Darktribe, showing up every now and then. The ending was top, and Dogi talking about reaching Felghana soon, is a perfect continuity move. And apparently in this version of Ys, Adol has a son with Lilia. 

Bump combat(simpler than Chronicles obviously), Roo rod, labyrinths, fast moving bosses. It has it all. Plus an El Dorado storyline, which fits Adol's adventurer theme perfectly. ",Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Neutral,

"**New World**

I went from wanting to get up early to play this game to not wanting to turn it on over the course of an evening. It's just not good. Once the sparkle and shine of great graphics and sound design fade away, you're left with the most bland game on the planet.

They copy-pasted a bunch of mobs -- I'd argue there's only like 10-15 actual mobs in the entire game. They even copy-pasted a town. There's already so many bots on my server, people participating in wars are getting banned by other players. There's no incentive to PvP (the 10% xp boost is meaningless), there's no incentive to craft until you're level 200 with perfect boosts/trophies. Getting skills to 150+ takes ridiculous amounts of gathering in newbie zones (fighting with bots over 300,000 of a particular resource)... and the combat? It's just so buggy. Oftentimes my attacks go through enemies, there's stuttering, weapon delay is botched, etc. New World has literally the worst healing gameplay I think I've ever played.

I genuinely can't think of any reasons to praise the game aside from graphics and sound. In fact, most every little thing in this game is just done so poorly -- the server transfer issue, the lack of filtering/sorting options on the market boards, the non-existent story, the fact that there's only two different kinds of quests (kill X or collect Y), the fact that there's barely any dungeons, the fact that the bosses have no actual mechanics.... I could go on. This game is mediocre at best. ",Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Negative,

Recently finished this. I can see why itâ€™s highly regarded by fans. The game makes you *feel* like Batman through the combat, use of gadgets and the chance to face off against some of his rogue gallery. I liked that the more I got used to the gameplay, the more immersed I felt as Batman. Pulling off combos and sneak attacks was fun. 

The plot was fairly tight and I enjoyed the linear progression between areas, it made the game feel like you were playing a night in the life of Batman. The villains were decent however my gripe would be the boss fights were not exactly enjoyable or easy to play. The Joker final fight was especially anticlimactic. However, I do admit the Scarecrow scene that glitches your pc was the standout villain moment. That legitimately had me spooked.

Wanted to get in the spirit of spookiness so I jumped in and played this for the first time. I liked it a lot!

The sections where something is chasing you felt very balanced between giving you the freedom to try to go about it whichever way you want, but still making the creatures feel threatening. INSIDE is another game that had similar segments where you had to avoid enemies, but it would railroad you into one specific way through each scenario, whereas Little Nightmares lets you try to do things the way that looks right to you.

"# Malice & Greed

This one's weird, but in a good way.

I'm tempted to describe Malice & Greed as a deck builder first and foremost, even though at the same time it's basically a party-based RPG revolving around creature collection. The group can feature up to four active party members (one of them is the protagonist), with up to four more characters chilling on the bench. 

Thing is, no one's willing to join you for whatever reason, so you have to abduct defeated enemies in order to bolster your ranks. Alternatively, defeated opponents can be butchered, which grants you (the protagonist, that is) a skill of theirs, or they can be benched so that they can be summoned later on if the need arises... or used as currency if an opportunity to do so presents itself. 

There's permadeath in play: defeated party members turn into corpses, thus basically gaining an extra health bar, but a corpse is (normally) unable to act, meaning it's pretty useless. Unless destroyed, corpses are resurrected after combat. Losing recruited party members is fine to a certain point, but losing the main character is the end of the line. 

Combat is turn-based. Each action requires energy that's shared by all the party members, and once it's gone, the enemies get to act. Rinse, repeat. All actions are based on skills the characters possess (up to six of them per character, with both active and passive ones sharing this limit), which, just like cards in more traditional deck builders, come with various keywords. Damage comes in various flavours (physical, **GUN**, fire, ice, arcane, and lightning), with resistances and weaknesses in play (exploiting weak spots is a way to gain extra energy, with extra damage usually being just a pleasant side effect), and there are loads of influential buffs and debuffs that you have to juggle.

And then there's the general vibe, which I'd describe as a mix between Paradise Killer and E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy. It's not quite there yet in terms of being finished (just like the game in general, with it being in early access), and for all I know, things may very well remain this way. After all, this isn't really a great genre for telling a story, even if Griftlands has gone ahead and done just that. Some worldbuilding here and there in the spirit of Slay the Spire, though? Now that's more realistic, and I feel that should be enough, in the end.

So, overall, Malice & Greed definitely gets my seal of approval even in its current state. It joined my backlog just a couple of weeks ago, and I'm happy that I've finally given it a spin. ",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,
"Finshed **Tales of Arise**.  Did everything except the post-game stuff and one of the training arena fights (the lvl 99 group fight, my party members suck at not getting hit and I couldn't manage to solo the second phase), clocked in about 75 hours.  I don't know if that counts time spent idling in menu, though; if it does, actual play time probably came out to about 60-63 hours.

Good value for the money.  Like I said in the previous week's post, it starts off pretty weak but gets stronger as you near the mid-game, and accelerates from there.  It remained good throughout, but the end of the game was pretty terrible and the final boss had me laughing because it was so goddamn stupid, real diabolus ex machina type shit.  The main character also has this moronic obsession with MAKE YOUR ENEMY YOUR FRIEND, as does everyone else... but that's shonen anime for you, I guess.  It comes with the territory, though it made it really hard for me to take the plot seriously.

I enjoyed the character development, though again, it's all just standard Naruto/Bleach-style cliches.

Gameplay was fun enough but by the end of the game I was getting really fucking tired of fighting the same 6-8 types of enemies over and over.  They all gained new gimmicks each time I saw them up through about the level 35-40 variants, but after that they didn't seem to gain anything new - at most they just swapped elements around and got better stats.  It's also why I haven't had any interest in doing the post-game stuff.  I went in for a bit and found it to be too easy and too boring so I think I'm going to shelve the game.  I might give Chaos a try on new game, but unless Chaos dramatically improves party member AI or otherwise ties them to player performance (like, the more you make perfect evades the more likely they are to make them or something) I don't see how it would be anything different from Hard.

The gameplay is just really shallow, and I think it has to be because your AI party members are pretty bad.  They take tons of damage that you, the player, can easily avoid, and micromanaging them is a huge pain in the ass - I went the extra yard and would turn off their spells to force them to use only the elements the target was weak to, but when you have a list of like 30 spells, and no ability to sort them by type or function, it's a real chore.

The game is also pretty unbalanced.  I think the second Lord was the only time I got stuck, and fixing that was literally as simple as equipping the ""take 50% less damage from this element"" accessory... since, again, I had no trouble avoiding the boss's attacks but my party members were constantly eating his spells and stabs.  I never did any grinding, though I killed everything in my way in every dungeon and would clear outdoor areas the first time through, and I picked up all of the chests, ore, etc.  I ended the game at level 60.  I feel like the game is designed for you to be fighting at a major disadvantage in order for there to be any challenge, because the final boss was level 61 and he was a complete joke - I was streaming it for a few friends and I literally went ""wait that's it?"" because the damn thing died so fast.  Even the level 99 boss in the training arena (probably intended to be the hardest boss in the game?) was pretty easy when I was tackling it at ~56, though again I couldn't clear it because when the rest of your party is dead because they suck at evading attacks, you're basically only allowed to get hit twice (the main character can get two stacks of KO Prevention, so the first two hits won't kill you.)

I also felt like some characters were dramatically more powerful than others.  The main character is incredibly overpowered, and in particular a single skill of his is *insanely* overpowered and once I got it, almost every fight basically became ""evade until an opening is available, spam out all of your AG on this one skill, evade while AG recharges, repeat.""  You get two healers, and one is *overwhelmingly* superior to the other.  You only get one mage, so the mage is virtually always in your group (I think there were a couple of bosses where I didn't bring the mage), and neither of your other options are particularly compelling (monk who dies constantly because he's terrible at evading or paladin who doesn't die very often but takes a ton of damage because she sucks at perfect guarding and so ends up consuming tons of your resources keeping her alive.)  Maybe that's just how JRPGs go or something.

Either way, the lack of balance and challenge are why I think I'm just going to give the post-game dungeons a pass.  Nothing new is presented in them and if you're any good at evading, the game is kind of a joke.

All things considered, though, I thought it was a good game and I definitely got my $60 worth.  I'd probably give it a comfy 83, losing points due to some programming jank (there's no save and quit option, you have to Alt+F4 out and the game always plays sound in the background with no option to turn it off, so I had to use Windows volume mixer to selectively mute the program any time I wanted to do something on another screen) and the aforementioned balance concerns.  Pretty enjoyable plot and characters, as long as you're in the mood for a Naruto/Bleach/Demon Slayer type of story experience, and the gameplay *is* pretty fun for the first 30-40 levels.

"I didn't post about it when I played it a 3-4 weeks ago, but I finally got around **Ratchet & Clank: A Rift Apart.**

I'll open this by saying that my first time really playing R&C was last year, when I nabbed the 2016 entry for 10 bucks. I liked a lot of what it had going for it, but ultimately it left an overall negative impression on me. The movie tie-in made it feel like the devs had their hands tied and couldnt quite tell the story they wanted to tell. It had very little uniqueness to it. But-- I saw the potential in the game, and as such left both disappointed but hopeful for the next entry.

And boy, did Rift Apart exceed expectations. On a technical level, it is the gold standard for games. While other games will ultimately exceed it in the coming years, right now, Rift Apart is a cut above everything else on the market. An amazing showcase for the PS5, an example of what games will look like when we fully transition to the new generation instead of releasing games on both generations.

While its graphical fidelity and overall technical marvels have come to define Rift Apart, it also excels in the very areas that that last entry failed badly: Its story, character work, originality, and gameplay-story cohesion. This is the game Insomniac wanted to make. The levels/maps are unique and well-designed, the new characters are a welcome addition, the pacing is perfect, and goodness, the cutscenes are pixar-level. My only complaint is that its a tad bit too easy, with stuns and summons being plentiful by the end of the game. I didnt die once in the final sequence. I'll be sure to play it on the hardest difficulty next time (and there will be a next time), but either way, it was such a fun time that I mostly looked past that.

For me, its somewhere between a 9 or a 9.5.",Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Neutral,
"**Metroid Prime**

While everyone is playing Dread, I bought myself a Gamecube and am playing a Metroid game for the very first time. This was the only top Gamecube game I could find at my local retro video game shop and I'm super pleased with it.

First of all, few games are as immersive as Prime. Even two decades later, on a first playthrough, after having just completed a technical marvel on PS5, I find myself completely entrenched in this experience. The visor is fucking amazing.

The level design is among the best in existence and I dont say that lightly. Unbelievable how clever it is. The upgrades allowing me access to a new area in a genius way blows my mind and makes me giddy every damn time. Just genius. And dont get me started on the music.

Now that said, the experience does have its negatives. Not being able to look down while moving is perhaps a poor choice for a first person game with platforming elements; its very easy to fall when jumping between ledges. The save point discrepancies are damn-near hardcore by todays standards, although pretty rewarding when you find a save spot on low health. Having to backtrack a lot, though a function of Metroidvania, occasionally is pretty time-consuming, disorienting and annoying. Especially when the aforementioned lack of save points has me traversing old ground when I die in ways that feel more tedious than anything else. God the Phason Mines fucking suck the first time you go in there..

I know that my longest paragraph thus far is covering the games negatives, but still, the game is absolutely a 10/10 all-time masterpiece, and I'm not even done yet. I'm making my way into Quarantine A after having just got the X-ray visor and plasma beam. So excited to see what comes next, because this game holds up better than almost any two-decade long game I've ever played. Just incredible. ",Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Neutral,
"**Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous**

No spoilers.

I'm nearly 50 hours in the game and I'm having a blast so far. I don't have prior knowledge to the Pathfinder system or DnD in general so I'm still learning the game mechanics even at this point. My main character is a Spell Master and I couldn't have picked a worse class to start out. It got better eventually though.

There are some insane difficulty spikes in this game. The Act 2 boss took me over an hour to beat. I probably only got lucky with RNG because they kept tripping on all the CCs while I blast them with arrows/spells. You probably won't even notice they're gonna be the boss fight since the room you fight them in is so innocuous. They could kill your entire party in one turn if you don't pre-CC them.

The absolute worst part in this game is the Crusade mode though. I play a lot of strategy games and losing one battle would typically not result in game over. In this game, if you lose a battle, morale will constantly drop preventing you from recouping your losses. It's really frustrating so I just gave my self 10k troops and save myself the trouble.

The Crusade mode definitely needs more tweaking. The main part of the game is actually very good. Customization is insane, especially if you're a spellcaster, and there's so much content in the game. ",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,

"* **Outward:** So far my favorite purchase out of my last batch. This game is hard as hell, I have quit and restarted probably half a dozen times but somehow I'm still not tired of it and will probably play again today. The death system is punishing, managing inventory is very fun for me though and makes it feel the most like you're actually camping/traveling out of any game I've played in a minute. The survival mechanics like hunger and thirst and need for sleep are fun. Combat is hard and janky, which is part of the reason I keep getting my ass handed to me about ten feet from the city gates. I think the learning curve on this one will be extremely steep but rewarding. I kind of appreciate that the game doesn't tell me anything and just dumps me into this world as a peasant and is like ""Go earn 150 bucks in five days or we're taking your house, byeeeeeeeeee"" Already loving the crafting/cooking systems.

Or I don't understand it, but in either case it isn't fun.

I'm going to dig around in the menu today and see if there isn't a solution there. I've heard people complain that the combat in this game is repetitive and boring but since I'm not really playing it for the combat I think I'll still like it as long as the story is good.

"**Battletech:** Still sinking a lot of hours into this one but still not feeling like I've really mastered it or really got the hang of all the different mechs and weapons. I've moved forward in the story having just finished the _Served Cold_ story mission. Frustratingly, I ended up trashing the Catapult that I'd hoped to salvage which is an annoying part of the grind in this game. I know that if I want to salvage I need to stop leaning so heavily on my long-range missle boats, but I find them so effective that it's a hard habit to kick. Also, I've really not had much luck with auto-cannons as an alternative. 

It might be a testament to the balance of the game that I've been unable to find any just completely killer builds for my mechs. I was excited to finally salvage a Hunchback since one [tier list](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/mech-tierlist.1110840/) thread I'd been looking at had called it the ""best mech in the game"". Then the first time I deployed it, it got chewed up pretty bad and I was generally unimpressed. I've since gotten a little more joy out of it, but it's definitely not a game changer.

Finally, I've run into the annoying problem of having the pirate faction hate me and thus being locked out of the black market. I do wish I'd had more of a heads-up on that from the start. I've been slowing trying to rebuild my pirate reputation, but it's really hard to find pirate missions that I can take. Which is another annoyance in the game that you really don't know if you'll find the right missions (or any missions for that matter) before you jump to another system. I've pretty much resorted to save-scumming just as a way to navigate the star map.",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,
"**Marvel's Avengers:** I had zero interest in this game since I'm not into multi-player loot grind games (I hated Destiny 2), but since this hit Gamepass, I thought I'd give it a try for the single-player story campaign that it _kinda_ has. I say _kinda_ because some of the missions are still for multiple heroes, but the AI will take the others and, to be honest, they seem to do _okay_. Or at least, they don't get in the way too much and don't need any baby-sitting (so far, at least). I did knock the difficulty down to story mode during one early boss fight with the Hulk and Abomination because it was a pain-in-the-ass and it felt like the game really hadn't bothered to tell me WTF to actually do. It was an unwelcome early difficulty spike. In fact, in terms of tutorial, the game does this really weird thing where you do several story missions before you open up the training room in the Chimera and only _then_ does it really give you a tutorial on how  the combat is supposed to work. Prior to that it does have _blink and you'll miss 'em_ pops up telling you stuff right in the middle of a bunch of baddies wailing on you. It really is rather odd. Either you've already worked this shit out by then, or else they should have had that much earlier in the game. 

Anyway, to the campaign so far (I've just unlocked the ""Ant Hill""). I do like the main character of Kamala, and it's nice to have some diversity, since very few games feature a female main character with a serious case of ""man hands"". I do love her giddiness and wonder as she meets the Avengers and visits Avenger related locations. She is a charming guide for the player. Now full disclosure, I'm really not much of a Marvel fan and mostly can't be bothered at this point even trying to piece together the Marvel ECU. I'm honestly not even sure which movies I've seen and which I haven't. I know I saw the first Avengers (in 3D in a theater! It was just alright) and the first Iron Man (also alright), but honestly can't remember if I saw the second. I can't remember if I saw Captain America at all. I think I might have. It was clearly forgettable. I did really like the Guardians of the Galaxy movies however. Anyway, all that is to say that I'm not married to the Marvel ECU so I really wasn't bothered that the character models didn't look like the actors from the movies. Although I certainly wouldn't have said no to some Scarlet Johansson, but that's beside the point. Anyway, there are some rather obvious gaping plot holes which I supposed might be explained somewhere, but I'm not optimistic that they will be. For example (early spoilers ahead I supposed), how the heck does the Chimera that >!went down in San Francisco< end up in >!Utah< despite being >!completely broken<? And how does AIM and, basically everybody else, not already know about this? And you early on you need to find >!Jarvis< in order to find out where !>Tony Stark< is only for the big reveal to literally be >!he's in his house<. Like, seriously? Nobody thought to look there? (yeah, I know it's >!his ancestral home, or whatever, but still...I think I might have looked there<) And there's the classic question of how the heck does Bruce keep finding convenient clothes to wear after hulking out.

The game (at least the campaign I've engaged with) is okay. Not great, but okay. However, the whole currency / gear thing is just absolutely horrible and confusing to the point that I'm mostly ignoring it because I literally have no fucking idea how it's even supposed to work. Firstly, even getting into the campaign is not as straight-forward as it ought to be. On loading, you'll first get a shouty pop-up telling you that you can have some free stuff. Then you have to jump through at least a couple of menu clicks before you even get to select a campaign and, annoyingly, it always seems to default to something else rather than the campaign I'm playing (I'm not even sure what the other options are, I haven't bothered with them yet). What's wrong with a big f'ing ""CONTINUE"" button right on the first screen like every other game? That's rhetorical, I know why, because they want to push you towards their multi-player pay-to-win grindfest instead of the single player campaign. That's just shitty. And then there's a bunch of confusing loot things that I can't make head nor tail of. Including some things labeled as ""FREE"" which when you look at them still cost credits. So...what part of that is supposed to be ""FREE""?

The loot that I have found is boring and my engagement with it has amounted to press the key that equips the ""best"" one and watch a number get slightly larger. Wow. I'm hoping by sticking to the lowest difficulty and just straight-lining through the story I won't have to worry about it any more than that. It's a shame, because they probably could have made a really entertaining romp through the Marvel universe, but instead they cluttered the way with a whole bunch of confusing shit and repetitive grindy crap that spoils the experience.

"**Super Monkey Mall Banana Mania**

I like it, but I feel like the performance can really take a hit sometimes. I don't know if it's just my Nintendo Switch OLED, but it seems when my character' speed starts to increase, it's like he teleports further along the platform because of the inconsistent FPS. Has anyone else experienced this? I'm trying to complete the last round of the Volcano world within fifteen seconds, but it's super difficult and the distraction is making it hard to experiment.

"**Metroid Dread**

I don't usually buy games near release; in fact, I pretty much only buy stuff on sale, but I got a Switch last year and there are some games that seem like they won't ever get sales on Switch, so it actually makes sense to buy them on release and enjoy it alongside the hype. This is definitely one of them!

I'd actually never played a Metroid game before this was announced, but once I heard about it, I decided to play Super Metroid on SNES Online. Dread feels exactly like a modernized version of Super. Other than the E.M.M.I. sections, it feels like the same gameplay loop. And I'm pretty happy with that because I really liked Super Metroid, but had some difficulty with the fact that it was such an old game. This game feels so much smoother and is more satisfying to move around in. It's also far less difficult to know where to go, though I still have plenty of exploration left to do. The boss battles have been great so far - some of them quite difficult, and others more reasonable.

I have made a larger dent in it so far than I expected. I'm betting I'll beat the story in the next few days and then spend a few days cleaning up the collectibles. I actually think the short length is a good thing. Nearly every game I've played lately, I've been powering through so I could beat it and move onto the next game. I didn't feel very incentivized to do non-optional content, partly because some of these games are longer, and partly because I just wanted to try something else. But this game I plan to 100%, partly to get my money's worth (after all, I spent $90 CAD on this compared to the $10 I spent on God of War that I played right before this; I'm enjoying this game way more), and partly because it's just so much fun.

My problem is that you are only under threat in very obvious situations and when you are your only goal is escape.

I really, really wanted to like this title.

I absolutely adore Subnautica, spent tens of hours on it, it scared me, made me feel things.

Obviously, _Below Zero_ wouldn't have as strong an impact on me, but I was still looking forward to the sense of discovery, base building, progression. But... man, is it tedious. And I don't think it's just because I already know the mechanics, I just think _Below Zero_ is very poorly designed.

""What happened?"" I wondered.

_Entering spoiler territory, stop reading if you don't want to get spoiled_

Discovery in this game is a pain and absurdly confusing. The land aspect especially, The Arctic Base was such a chore to explore and map. I made the Snowfox but read so many hilarious and sad comments about it that I just left it at the base and explored on foot.

The labyrinthine map of that base is just absurd. I've been playing for decades (several!) and I have a great sense of orientation, but even today, I'm still not sure I've explored everything from the base I need to.

Right now, I have a Seatruck that can go down to 1000m, a few unexplored caches, but I'm honestly not sure if I'm going to bother. I feel so annoyed at this game. And it breaks my heart because I hold Subnautica in such a high esteem.

"**Sable**

This game is seriously beautiful. Its super unique art style really resonates with me, as does its open-ended exploration. 

Its definitely not for everyone. Its much more focused on a sense of pure exploration than most open-world games. There is no action, and much of the exploration is driven by your own desire to see the world rather than any epic quests, valuable loot, or grand overarching narrative. There are plenty of quests, but they are more about introducing you to the game's different areas and people.

Much of my enjoyment of the game comes from seeing the sights, learning about the world and its quaint inhabitants and their sense of purpose, and just soaking up the atmosphere. I have spent plenty of time simply admiring the landscapes accompanied by the game's moving and calming soundtrack. I have also enjoyed the puzzles so far, though most are fairly simple or straightforward.

Unfortunately it has quite the amount of technical issues: fps drops, stutters, tons of bugs, and general jankiness. I put it on hold once the performance issues really started to dampen the experience, but picked it right back up when they released a patch last week to address some of the issues. Hopefully the first of many. There is still a ton that needs fixing/improving, but the performance is noticeably better now. Not great, but definitely better.

I originally beat the first half of the game about a month ago, then immediately got my ass handed to me in the second half, so I put it down for a while. I decided to return (heh) to it this weekend and managed to knock out the second half in basically one long sitting. 

Man, what a tough but satisfying experience. Because of the stressfulness/intensity of the game, I thought I would be relieved once I finally completed it then moved onto to something else. But now I'm actually getting the itch to play more, so maybe I'll go for some of the achievements.

I keep thinking about the bosses and their incredible design. The scale of the creatures and your battles with them, the sheer amount of projectiles EVERYWHERE, and their terrifying, intimidating visual design. The boss fights are a spectacle, and makes overcoming them truly feel like a huge feat.

I also really liked the worldbuilding and atmosphere that is present throughout the game, though I gotta say I still have no idea what the story was about outside of the major plot points lol.

"**Far Cry 6** is what I've been playing since it came out. By the game's count I'm about 60% of the way through the main storyline, but I've still got five regions to explore. It feels like the biggest game map I have EVER played on, and twenty hours into the game I'm still not sure if it's a pro or a con.

On the one hand, you're getting your money's worth because there's more content than most people could possibly finish included in the game. And this kind of encourages a long-term immersion by playing it slowly over time (fighting it out like the guerrilla war that it is and slowly building your reputation) versus just binging the game in a single weekend. If I can make it to the end of the game I feel like the satisfaction/payoff will be huge there because of my emotional investment in the main character has had time to grow. Dani Rojas is my favorite Far Cry protagonist so far by far.

BUT...the size of the map is almost overwhelming, and twenty hours in I'm already feeling the twinges of burnout that have kept me from scrubbing any of the Far Cry games past the main campaign. There's an intense amount of travel that needs to be done and unless you use fast travel it gets pretty grueling.

Here are some of the other pros and cons that I've run into:

**Pros**

* **Quest Progression:** There's always tons of stuff to do and you can pretty much tackle it in any order you want. Wide variety of missions and side content.
* **Loot:** Pretty good loot for going off the beaten path a little bit, like in treasure hunts or Yaran Stories. I haven't needed the loot much so far because I'm a creature of habit and I've just been upgrading the same suppressed assault rifle from the beginning of the game. Between that and an upgraded suppressed sniper rifle I've got pretty much half the base killed before they get leery. There is a staggering amount of weapons to choose from though, so if you prefer poison or fire or explosives they've got you covered.
* **Story:** Love the main character, love the side characters, love the different revolutionary groups, love to hate the villains. I have no complaints here at all really. For me the story is what carries me between the action sequences, I've always preferred RPGs to shooters so the narrative is important to me.
* **Open world:** Best-looking open world in the Far Cry series so far. Made me wish for a VR helmet the entire time. The water is gorgeous. The animals are realistic-looking. The people move and talk in realistic ways. Foliage is beautiful. Horseback riding is fantastic. In fact all of the traversal methods in the game are pretty fun, which kind of takes the sting out of the map size.

**Cons**

* **Enemy respawn:** This shit is annoying. There's almost no point in clearing enemy heavy areas because they will pop right back in after you leave, may as well just avoid them or run around unless you're farming XP. They need to at least slow down enemy respawn a little and let you take control of territory briefly.
* **Platforming:** The platforming feels pretty janky. It's not so bad that it makes you want to avoid platforming sections, but it can get frustrating at points because the markers for climbable surfaces are not clearly marked.
* **Inconsistent tone:** This may not be a con for some people and it's not a huge one for me, but jumping back and forth between ""omg fascists are shooting people to death in the streets"" and ""omg look at this cute wheelchair dachshund"" vibes is jarring. The game goes back and forth between lighthearted banter and Pan's Labyrinth level torture and it's a little weird. The game also goes back and forth between realism and like, Yakuza-level camp. I think Far Cry has always had this to a degree but it's more noticeable in this title for some reason.

Overall I'm very glad I bought it and I'm enjoying it, I'd give it a ~~9/10~~ 8/10. It's my favorite Far Cry so far, even beating out Far Cry 3 just because it's such a quality-of-life improvement mechanics-wise (especially with piloting vehicles). If weren't into big-ass Ubisoft sandboxes before, you probably won't like this one either. But it's a very fun playground to mess around in if you do like open world sandboxes.

"Been playing **Hitman 3** (well, mostly Hitman 1 and 2 *in* Hitman 3). Played through some of the DLC missions from those games that I hadn't checked out, boy that last mission in the Patient Zero campaign can really go off the rails quickly. I had to wipe out almost the entire hospital because the virus just kept spreading. Game is still great, and from my couple of runs through the first level of Hitman 3 I've noticed that it doesn't have as many of the ""Mission Stories"" that basically handhold you through killing your targets: 3 per level, as opposed to 5 or 6 per level in the previous games. However those opportunities still exist, you just have to actually find them yourself without any assistance (in Dubai for instance, there's >!the business with the exploding golf ball or the security protocol!<). I think that's a really good balance, because while the Mission Stories are very satisfying they also kind of cut down on elements of discovery and improvisation that I think are key to the Hitman DNA.

It was miles better than Iron Storm though, which was a really truly awful game. Oddly enough WWZ seemed really similar to another weird shooter I played called Bet on Soldier.

"**Metroid Dread**

I got my copy a day early, and i really liked playing it. The last Metroid game i played was i think Metroid prime? So i am not really up to date with my Metroid lore. But i enjoyed the story a lot. 

Honestly the biggest thing for me, is the gameplay is super smooth, fluid, and fast. It is probably one of the best Metroidvania's i have ever played in terms of just how good the game controls. The combat is a ton of fun, and the EMMI's can be pretty damn terrifying, running away from them bouncing off walls, sliding under ducts while playing a game of cat and mouse is amazingly fun. 

My biggest issue is frankly, the game is short, i finished it with ~85% map completion in around 7-8 hours? Pretty much two sittings. For $90 CAD game, it is pretty disappointing. I will probably go back and 100% the completion, which will take +1/2 hours. 

My other issue is the environments / the map itself, my gold standard for metroidvania's is basically hollow knight, you know when you finally get to city of tears or descend into the deep nest for the first time, there is a sense of awe in a lot of the areas. I never really found that in this game, and while some boss battles are really impressive and a ton of fun. You could put pictures of areas in hollow knight, and i probably ether had a fond memory, or could probably draw the surrounding areas from memory. Never was really impressed in that regard with dread. ",Positive,Positive,Negative,Neutral,Positive,neutral

Eh. Something is to be said about ""Fresh launches"" of most MMOs being a blast, but at this point in my life I just see tons of glaring issues with the game that people get mad if they're brought up.

* Absurdly shallow character creation
* The worst quests I've ever seen in an MMO that I've personally played (I'm not kidding, Vanilla WoW quests are better. OSRS quests are better. How is this acceptable?) 
* Absolute lack of enemy variety
* Iffy combat. Some people hate it, some people love it. I personally find it really boring, but that's fixable at least
* Excessive amounts of on-foot trecking back and forth. It would be one thing if mounts or something were unlocked at a certain point, but from my understanding they aren't currently planned, but fast travel booster packs are? Great.

"**Last Epoch**

This game was purchased for $34.99. It is currently in Early Access.

I could probably be reductive and call this game ""Alternate Universe Diablo 3"" and I don't feel I'd be wrong. It takes some core Diablo 2 concepts such as Classes having three ""archetypes"" or trees, and Charms taking up inventory to give additional stats and brings them to the next level in terms of quality of life. 

What I find to be the game's strength is where PoE goes all in on it's complexity Last Epoch finds a good balance. Your skills have deep trees that are easily readable in terms of element type thanks to UI art, and all of it's scaling is easily told to you. For example, a skill will have Tags on it such as Physical, Minion, Fire, Melee, Ranged and pretty much any item or Relic with those tags will work with it.

Now when I say early access I do mean it. The game's endgame system is in (It's essentially Maps from PoE but you travel along a spider-web to fill a bar to unlock a Big Boss) but the Story Campaign and a few classes' are missing a specialization. As of this writing, Occultist and Rogue are missing a 3rd spec, but the other three are complete. Multiplayer is also not in yet, but the Developers seem to have that as their next big objective. But the game is perfectly functional and as of the last patch I've not found any crashes or bugs.

My big problem with the game (Which I think some may prefer) is the game's boss fights. During the story they're fine and there is a big emphasis on having High Damaging/Lethal attacks being telegraphed similar to FF14 with glowing zones on the ground. The Current final boss is a bit much having two different boss fights together in one, but that may change.

The issue is once you get to late game, Mechanics Overlapping gets to be obnoxious. One boss had me constantly dealing with a 6 way cross attack that would always be tracking my movement, a spiral AOE, *and* a melee AoE that sends a shockwave forward and backward. **Constantly** . And while I don't have an optimized character in terms of damage, these fights last a long while and can even have an intermission phase of you just killing adds. If you die, you gotta do it all over again. 

It feels like Mythic Raiding in WoW and I don't know if I want that in my ARPG. Some might however. Overall though I've enjoyed my time with the game but the late game  boss fights just sap the will out of me. ",Positive,Neutral,Positive,Negative,Neutral,

"**Diablo 2 Resurrected (Switch)**

The premise here is that I only really bought this to have D2 on Switch. I didn't care for the remastered/resurrected part and just wanted to play D2 on the go or in bed, as its one of my all time favourites. It's also the perfect excuse to play it again.

And with that premise, it delivers in all regards. Of course the graphics aren't as good as the other versions, but they're not bad either. No shitty textures or blurry resolution. It basically looks like a ""Diablo 2 HD"" version. Sharp and with better lighting. Perfect.  

Gameplay wise its good ol' D2 with some welcome small QoL changes like auto gold pick up, more stash space, hotbars for skills(at least on console) hotkeys to autofill, Ladder only Runewords in offline now, etc. Just the stuff you need without touching the core elements of the game(unless you think clicking like a maniac to pick up gold, *was* a core element.)

There's 20 years worth of articles and thoughts on this game, so I'm not gonna review it. But one thing is really refreshing after so many modern ARPGs: it has an actual end. You play it, then you finish it and move on. No ridiculous amount of endgame activities that feel like phone game gimmicks to keep you playing. If im putting 200hrs into this, then I do it because I wanna play the game, not because I'm desperately trying to finish never ending endgame grinds.

Honestly, the only downside is the community. The fight between hype and hate, is nothing new for new releases these days, and definitely nothing new for Blizzard games (as they tend to attract the worst people for some reason). But the amount of fighting between people over the smallest things, is just tiresome to witness. Especially the fight between the ""don't change anything!!"" corner and the ""where are all the new features??"" corner is just a never ending spiral of diarrhea. A bit of a shame if you wanna be part of the community.

I've been playing this pretty much non-stop since release. If you thought about the Switch version, I definitely recommend it. Actually, the port has been so good, I'm now considering checking out D3 on Switch as well. Which I always thought is not worth checking out if you have it on PC already. But given how great D2 works on it, I'm intrigued now to see if D3 also works. If anyone here owns it on Switch, I'd be thankful for some hands on info.

"**Demon's Souls** 

I've played and beaten DS1-3, BB, and Sekiro multiple times each, but I'm just not jiving with Demon's Souls. I've killed something like 6 bosses at this point, and none of them have been all that enjoyable to fight. 

I don't know if I've suddenly gotten a lot worse at these games, but the 2 areas I've been working on (Depraved Chasm and Island's Edge) have been kicking my ass. There are red phantom enemies next to normal enemies that are a real pain in the ass. And if dealing with 2 guys with burning spears wasn't enough, now I have to deal with *3* guys with burning spears, one of which has a ton more health and deals way more damage. Or I have to deal with 2 rolling skeletons simultaneously. And it's damn near impossible to just run by enemies in both of these zones; good luck running past 6-7 skeletons who roll after you.

I think I'm going to put it down until I feel like giving it another shot. ",Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Neutral,

Really enjoying my time with this. I'm about 10 hours in and probably will complete with two more play sessions.

Playing on the ""Expert Spirit Guide"" difficulty, and some bosses or challenge chests have taken me 10+ tries at times. 

The combat and skill tree gives you just enough to keep stuff fresh as you progress through the game. The exploration is great too. I enjoy the mini map isn't filled with everything to find, and you do have to seek it out on your own. You will stumble on enough to get you through the game, but it's enjoyable to explore and find mini puzzles to get more rot and karma.

"**Kena Bridge of Spirits**

I'm a fair way into this. It's starting to lose me a bit.

It's my kind of game - quasi-open world but with enough linearity to push you along, great to look at, kind of a meditative tone rather than zombies jumping out from around corners. The music and ambience are nice.

But for whatever reason, I don't think the developers bothered to put much around those really good bones. There is NO story here. I have no idea what the protag's background is, or whether she has a personality. The dialogue is generic stuff about the spirit of the forest and things like that, all whispered as if there's more to it than there really is. And nice as it is, I'm tired of running around the forest. It's all kinda samey at this point (though perhaps that changes later on).

The combat started out ok, but at some point the boss battles require precision and mechanical fluidity that the game can't provide. The camera is a pain in the ass and the controls are clunky (though to be fair, I'm not sure I've ever enjoyed bow-and-arrow mechanics in any game). As others have pointed out, the difficulty spike is a bit much and the battles become a grind on the hardest difficulty. There's no leveling as such - you just need to use the same limited arsenal of attacks to take tiny chunks of health from the opponent until the meter's finally empty.

I guess my conclusion is the game is a 7/10 or so that could have been an 8.5 or 9 with another six months in the oven. Too bad because there's not much out there on PS5 like this at the moment. ",Negative,Neutral,Negative,Negative,Neutral,neutral

**Life Is Strange**

Episode 1 is free, so this was a no-brainer really. Well regarded generally, praised by reviewers that I match with personality-wise, I've enjoyed interactive-movie kinda games before, and if I enjoy it then it's not too expensive to get the rest of the episodes. And damn, did I enjoy it. Max is an incredibly relatable protagonist, for a start - at least, she was for me. I found myself getting emotional at not the ""big"" events, but the smaller things, such as the difficulty of approaching difficult topics with close friends, or being unable to believe in your own talents. I am fearful that some of the story threads being set up may end up being treated without the respect they deserve, but based on this opening episode, I don't think that fear will ever be proven true. A solid **9** out of ten for this opening, and will be pushing Detroit for the best in genre.

Even the things it does well, like the Bioware companions, meaningful choices, and lore/worldbuilding pale in comparison to its contemporaries. It's insane to me that Witcher 3 came out just a few months after Inquisition -- really shows just how ahead of its time Witcher 3 was even with all its flaws.

"**Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice**

For reference, I have played every other Souls-adjacent game (Demon's, DS1-3, BB).

Not too impressed with this one right now. Haven't gotten all that far yet (have only beaten 1 major boss and a bunch of minibosses), but I can't say I'm digging the combat too much yet. It just feels way too simplistic. The best strategy against a lot of basic enemies is to literally stand in front of them and wait for them to attack, parry, and then do your attacks. It feels so limiting, nearly every encounter I'm doing the exact same thing. I can't say that the Souls games always encouraged you to mix up your strategy either (rolling through attacks takes care of a lot of bosses throughout the series), but the difference in Sekiro is you *can't*. There are like 3 different things I can do in battle at any given time, there's no opportunity to change up my approach. 

And then there's the boss fights. As of right now, I'm mostly talking about the minibosses, but I haven't really liked any of them much. The chained ogre was pretty annoying, and not because it was super difficult, but because the tracking on his grabs was fucking insane. I backdashed his diving grab a few times and got punished (rightfully), so next time I made sure to try to adjust and dodged to the side. I have a clip saved on my PS5 of when I did this, because he legit snapped 90 degrees to the right, *mid-dive*, to still grab me. Again, I was probably supposed to either jump this or space far enough out that I wouldn't be next to him when he did it, but this is another case of there being a 'right answer', and even if something else makes sense, you get nonsensically punished for doing it.

The worst by far was the blazing bull though. This has to be by far one of the worst bosses in a FromSoft game. The entire game up to this point is telling you to stop dodging and focus on your parry timings and counters for the red warning sign attacks. And then this boss shows up and parrying is useless, but you're still stuck in this limiting combat system. It feels like the combat system was made for exactly one kind of fight (sword duels), so trying to do anything else just leads to a frustrating and uninteresting fight. The strat that worked for me was basically just running behind him and getting hits whenever he stopped for a second, and slowly draining his health away. Not interesting in the slightest, and not even risky once I figured out that worked. Aside from that, the hitboxes on this boss were wacky as all hell- he charged more or less straight through me without hitting me more than once, and other times he'd nudge his head and it would connect. So unclear as to when the head hitbox was actually active.

I'm hoping it comes together towards the middle and end, but for now I'm just kind of sick of fighting every single regular enemy the same way, and really hoping the game mixes things up soon. ",Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Neutral,neutral
"**Psychonauts 2** - 8/10

Fantastic game all around. But I wanna talk in this short review about the one big thing I didnt like: pacing.

It has two parts. The first part refers to the bad pacing when you are in gameplay. Well, you will not play long BECAUSE EVERY 5 SECONDS THERES A CUTSCENE. Jesus, let me play, Tim! I love the feel of the game, the discovery and the world. But man it sucks me out way too often. Sometimes I played 20 minutes and watched 15 min of videos and played 5 minutes.

The second part about pacing: I feel like the intro is too long, as well as the ending. But my favorite part was the ""open world"". When you get to discover things, interact with the weird characters. But it feels like his parts is about 2 hours before you get the ""prepare yourself"" memo.

The combat is fun and I enjoyed the characters but like most games, it is just too long for what it is, so towards the end the combat becomes stale after killing the same enemy 2.9 billion times. It's exacerbated by the fact that the last dungeon is literally hours long of fighting the same enemies over and over and nothing else. Scarlet Nexus really shines in the mid-point of the game when everything starts to click for both the story and the gameplay. Those hours are tons of fun.

"Recently started **Pathfinder: Kingmaker** and having an absolute blast. Finished both Pillars of Eternity before, and they were both amazing too.

"Been playing a ton of Genshin Impact. Needed something new to just dump time in after I got a little burned out on FFXIV. But, I feel like I'm starting to run up against the design just a bit.

**[Giana's Return](https://www.gianas-return.de/)**. Maybe it's the ice level, but the controls felt a little floaty for a while. Otherwise, it feels a bit different from the original with the boss battles (which are seem a bit too similar to each other) longside the health bar.

**[Research & Development](https://www.moddb.com/mods/research-and-development)**, a half-life 2 episode 2 mod that was laying around. 

It seemed to have been recommended as a good mod, but I found a ""wrong"" solution to one of the puzzles, and got killed by an insta-kill trigger. Basically it involved using a gravity gun to knock down turrets to disable them rather than using the bulletproof glass the game was expecting me to use instead. 

There was also a fusebox with a ""don't touch the edges"" maze puzzle, which required multiple attempts because being a bit too close causes the object to move unexpectedly.

"**Train Valley 2**: It is structured quite differently from the first, as the train paths required are determined by the resources created, produced, or purchased by different stations. This makes the game seem more complex from the very start, which is mostly for the better, but I'm afriad the complexity may wear on me sooner. We'll see. In early levels, there's also welcome introductions to bridges and tunnels. Global stats when reaching 5 stars on any level are neat. ",Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,neutral
"**Geometry Wars 3 Evolved**: I am just over half way through adventure mode of this 2D shooter typically on a 3D plane. I wouldn't call it bullet hell since enemies dont shoot anything (bosses might), and powerups for your own shooting are relatively infrequent. Its also not a rhythm game, as only enemies pluse to the music, but I dont think they actually move on the beat. I'm having fun with it, playing several levels before I get stuck, then either going back to prior levels to get more stars or putting the game down to play...

"**Life is Strange: True Colors**

I'm a bit confused what to think about it.. `Overall`, I liked it. I loved the first Life is Strange, I wasn't fan at all of Before the Storm and I straight up refunded Life is Strange 2.  This one feels a lot like it's back to its roots.

What I really liked about it are `characters`. Alex is great playable protagonist, maybe not as good as Max from first game, but I found her relatable. Then Steph is amazing character and imho she makes very sincere relationship with Alex. The kiddo (Ethan) is very nice character and plays very well into the story and gameplay - it was really nice to >!play that RPG game with him!<. Then even Mac really well don character, tho I wish he played more into the story.. Anyway, generally there wasn't a bad character imho and that's by far the strongest aspect of the game. 

Now the `story` - it was good for the most part, however - I really didn't like how final chapter played out. It dragged for way too long  >!with flashbacks!< and then whole story resolution came abruptly and in a rush and it wasn't satisfying at all because of it, the kinda epilogue and different endings were also rather too cinematic and short. I wish it was way more interactive, like chat with people after events have concluded, etc.. It would have been nice touch if they did that - but sadly almost entire final chapter feels like one long cinematic with almost no interactivity - and that's my major disappointment with the game.

The second disappointment is - that it's still basically illusion of `choices` and choices either are completely just cosmetic and don't affect how story plays out, or are so minor and still don't affect almost anything at all. The only two things that matter (yes, something has effect on how game is tailored, but I wouldn't call it real choice -> consequence) >!are who you want to date - which is completely free choice based on personal taste and if you want to stay or leave at the end - which again is very free and independent choice of everything else!<. So yeah it rather falls flat in this department so don't expect anything like choices and consequences in for example Detroit: Become Human. 

Would I recommend it? Well if you like the first game, I think this one is closer to it than two previous ones, and it's nice interactive story sadly lacking a better weight on choices you make as well as how things conclude within final chapter - if that doesn't bother you, it's imho worth playing especially if you wait for discount.

I am still at the beginning hours, but so far the game feels painfully average, I feel like I am just going through the motions. I really don't understand where all the great reviews are coming from.

"**Deathloop**

It's been awhile since a game got such a tight hold on me. Can't put it down. It really feels like all the best parts of previous Arkane games all put together.

Loved dishonoured but I'm not a person who replays games much so I felt like there was a lot of stuff I probably missed. The loop mechanic in deathloop totally solves that. The 4 distinct areas have sub areas that open and close for different times of day as well as other changes that keep it fresh but you'll find your self finding new bits and pieces every run. Being able to swap out weapons and perks so you can go guns blazing, stealth melee, sneaky sniper or whatever else takes your fancy is fantastic.

There's no punishment for killing and you're really pushed to mix and match your powers and actually use them. Something that bothered a lot of people about dishonoured.

The voice acting is top notch, all the characters have layers that see fun or fun to hate on as you peel them back. Setting up events at one time of day to cascade into later ones just feels so good.

It's like a mix of No one lives Forver, dishonoured and edge of tomorrow as you get more and more effecient and comfortable in the play spaces. The weapon varients scratch my loot bug itch but I could see that being a bit of a turn off for others.

The stuff that could be improved is the UI when you're dealing with trinkets and perks. Feels a bit clumsy and takes longer than I'd like to switch things around. Not sure why you can't save load outs either unless I missed something.

Also it ran like garbage on my pc so I picked it up for ps5 where it runes basically locked 60. Would like a fov slider though. ",Positive,Neutral,Negative,Positive,Neutral,neutral

"The main thing I've been playing lately is **Hades** which has been in my crosshairs for awhile but I've never had time for it.

Aside from that there are an astonishing number of voicelines from the various characters that you cycle through as you finish runs. The story itself is also an amusing way to canonically fit the fact your dying over and over again.

"**The Last of Us 2**     
Early impressions were outstanding. Unlike many I *love* the route they went with Joel. Yes, I loved him too and yes, it would have been great to ride out as him again but this was a great way to motivate me to action as Ellie. And then, 30 minutes later I'm riding around chatting with my gf as if we're on holiday. My (irrelevant) take is this - newcomers have absolutely zero connection to Joel. Give the player a mission or two with Joel and Ellie. Really cement their bond through play. Make it count. And *then* deal the death blow as a prelude to a fucking bloodbath. Not only did they miss an opportunity to connect/reconnect but the impact was further lessened with the immediate gear shift into winsome exploration.

"**Super Mario Odyessey**

I have to say, the design of the levels is pretty darn good. The game looks clean, the music is so darn good, and collecting the purple coins was really fun. The gameplay was really good for the most part. It reminded me of the last great platformer I played which was Ape Escape for the PS1. The game is well made.

But the story and some of the dialogue are pretty darn cringy (the story at its core is >!the same as the previous games!< but they really try to make it look serious). I feel like there were way too many of those collectible bananas/moons, and some of the levels >!like the Luncheon Kingdom and New Donk City (I understand it's a reference to Donkey Kong, but it sounds like dong)!< don't look nice. The 2nd level is my favorite tho.

The characters make these noises in dialogue (which I have also noticed with the last 2 Nintendo exclusives that I've played) and it's so weird. The overall theme of this game feels out of place, especially in >!New Donk City and Bowser's Castle!<. ",Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Negative,neutral

on last weeks recommend post people said i should try this as an alternative open world game to just mowing down bandit camps. luckily there's a  ton of yakuzas on xboxgamepass4PC. it was *ok,* it was very niche, you have to like 1988 japans' tokyo scene. you also have to be kind of clued into the style of characterization for personalities and drama in japanese media, like anime. at the end of the day i learned that punching drunk street thugs is kind of not an okay thing to do just because you feel like beating people up. and that developers will pour everything into a skill tree/combat system because that's what people want. ã‚ã‚ŠãŒã¨ã†ã”ã–ã„ã¾ã™ ",neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Neutral,neutral

Grabbed this on Wednesday and have put 10 hours into it since. The combat is engaging and the questing loop feels good. That's not to say that they are well designed quests individually, but clearing 6-8 quests at a time, looting and harvesting along the way, and coming back to town to refine and craft with the raw materials and turn in your quests is very satisfying. Only being 10 hours in I can't really comment on how much longevity this game will have, but I will certainly get my $40 worth no matter what.",Positive,Neutral,Positive,positive,neutral,neutral
